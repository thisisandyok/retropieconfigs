		<name>2020 Super Baseball (USA)</name>
		<desc>Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.</desc>

		<desc>Playing as a jet pilot of the "Coalition" force, players take control of either an F-15 Eagle, or an A-10 Tankbuster jet. The mission is to neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring country. The Zarak army has many ground units, including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD missiles and armored vehicles.

To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the Zarak army, players venture out on numerous missions (called "sorties") that have varied and specific objectives. Typically, various installations such as radar sites, air bases or ground units are the target. Other missions include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying SCUD launchers before they fire. 

Pre-mission screens ask the player to select from the two planes. Then,  the player can specify the armament to carry into the sortie. Air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles are available for each of the planes. Here, a strategic choice between countering either air units or ground units has to be made, as each area (of which there are eight) is patrolled by opposing enemy F-15 jets.</desc>

Max is a kid who possesses a magic cap that allows you to travel across different world and to save people who get in trouble in other dimensions. But his archenemy, the demonic Skull Master, has recently locked all the portals Max was using for inter-dimensional travel. However, the Skull Master has kept some of the portals for himself, keeping there some of his destructive weapons. It's time to destroy those weapons and to stop Skull Master!

This is a platform game in which you control Max himself or one of his two side-kicks (that doesn't influence the gameplay). You travel through several different worlds. Your goal is to find Skull Master's weapons, which are scattered around the level, and to destroy them. The levels are timed, and there are also plenty of enemies who will disturb you on your way to the goal.</desc>

		<desc>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel. The game plays out much like an episode of the show. The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum. Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls. Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.</desc>

If the player does well, then his/her final challenge is to take on Al Unser, Jr. in the final event at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This race uses the Molson Indy Vancouver as a final test of the player's hard-earned skills. Of course, the player can also practice every stage of the game except the final stage. Go-kart racing involves regional action in the United States of America while snowmobiles provide challenge for the game's simulated winter months. Competing in the stock cars of the IROC is considered to be gaining experience for the faster and lighter open wheel vehicles of the Indy league.</desc>

		<desc>A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early 90s with his "Image is everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight players (male and female and as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</desc>

		<name>Barbie Super Model (USA)</name>
		<desc>Help Barbie become a great fashion model!  This is an arcade game with many different activities to participate in.

In each level, Barbie starts by going left to right with forced scrolling.  She has a default speed and can speed up as well.  She must avoid moving obstacles by moving up and down and controlling her speed.  If she hits one, she loses a chance and it's game over if she runs out of chances.  She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.

There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot.  You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level.  You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit.  You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these.  You are awarded points for each correct match.

When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice.  This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.

Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left.  On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up.  This brings you to another magazine cover.  You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover.  Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.

When you reach the left side of the level, you must then do Barbie's runway walk that you were given earlier.  You are awarded points for each station at which you perform the correct move.

Barbie then continues to the next level.  There are a total of four: Barbie driving down the street, skating on the beach, walking through a ski resort and walking through the park.</desc>

		<name>Beauty and the Beast (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Beauty and the Beast begins with a narrative that parallels the 1991 animated film-- an enchantress transforms a mean prince into a beast until such time that he could learn to love. One day, a woman named Belle happens into his castle. The Beast must pursue her through his own deadly castle for both their safety. This is a side-scrolling action platformer. The Beast is rather slow but with a powerful claw strike and jump-stomp attack. He can also scale certain types of walls and can catch the edges of platforms. He also has a special roar that allows him to stun certain enemies. This becomes necessary in some sections in order to freeze bats so the Beast can use them as stepping stones to higher platforms. The game has a time limit in the form of the magical rose. The Beast must battle through such levels as the dungeon and the main hall battling giant spiders, rats, rogue candle monsters, live gargoyle statues, and enchanted brooms, while collecting books for points (since Belle likes books) and magic mirrors that allow the Beast to see further into the current level to anticipate what challenges await.</desc>

		<name>Boxing Legends of the Ring (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Boxing Legends of the Ring is a boxing game, developed by Sculptured Software and published by Electro Brain.

During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).
 
The fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.</desc>

		<name>Cliffhanger (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. 

Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.

The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</desc>

		<desc>In addition to play by the original rules, Clue has an additional mode that allows movement via "points." Each turn begins with nine points and every action the player takes costs points. The player can only do as many things as he has points. For example, moving from square to square costs one point, making a suggestion costs three points. Many players prefer this mode of play as it makes the game more balanced since each player gets the same number of "moves" each turn.</desc>

You begin the game with a limited amount of fire power, but after shooting certain enemies power ups are left behind to increase your capabilities. Unlike many of the Darius games, if your ship is destroyed you don't lose all of the weapons you've collected; likewise you also continue on at the same point rather than being sent back to a checkpoint. Similar to many of the Darius games there are different routes that can be taken towards the final stage. At the end of each stage, you are shown a map and can select the next stage you would like to complete.</desc>

The players first controls a prehistoric sea organism, and fights to gain evolution points with which he can improve his fish's body parts and upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player's success. The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.</desc>

You will earn money for each race depending on how you placed (for instance, first place nets you $7000) which you can use to purchase upgrades for your car. You need to find a good balance between the parts. To test the effectiveness of your parts you can run a test race to see how the car works before you buy. Data can be saved on the cartridge so you will not lose your parts or your race statistics. The goal is simply to complete all sixteen tracks; you will get a bonus at the end depending on how well you do so there is an incentive to play again and do better.</desc>

The game features 16 distinct outdoor stadia. The League play features 189 clubs and 11 leagues. Each team has specific crowd chants incorporated into the ambient sound.

The action is faster than in previous versions, and AI has been expanded. Players have distinct facial feature and hair styles. Each match is introduced by Des Lynam and commentated on by John Motson and former Scotland international Andy Gray.</desc>

		<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

		<desc>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</desc>

		<name>FireStriker (USA)</name>
		<desc>A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and water
competed for the Trialight, a weapon created by the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united the four kingdoms. Wylde however, was not satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and defeat the monsters.

Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects) have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life. Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map. As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.

Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four players.</desc>

		<name>Football Fury (USA)</name>
		<desc>An American Football game featuring fictional teams. Even though, the teams are fictional, they are based on the real NFL team cities and the division setup of that time period. 

Gameplay involves the usual football fare of choosing a play and attempting to execute it. On offense, when throwing the football, a meter appears which measures the strength of the passer's throw. On defense, the player controls a defensive player and tries to tackle the opposing ball carrier or attempt to break up a pass play.

There is an option to either play with the background music on or off.</desc>

The coach gives advice before each fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each round.</desc>

There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. 

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</desc>

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing (USA)</name>
		<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

You'll guide him through all kinds of crazy capers, commandeering a tank, parachuting, using a jet pack, and fighting a giant rat, that will lead him to the parts he needs. When you're the size of an insect everything looks humongous, but even normal-sized people will agree that Harley's adventure is humongous.</desc>

		<name>Head-On Soccer (USA)</name>
		<desc>In this isometric football game, 50 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls.

While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his "standard players", who won't do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:</desc>

		<desc>Hebereke's Popoon is a block-grouping game closer in style to Dr. Mario than Tetris. There are eight playable characters, each having different abilities. In one-player mode, the player is forced to choose Hebereke and must play against Oh-Chan. After defeating Oh-Chan, the player is allowed to choose between Hebereke and Oh-Chan in the next match against Sukezaemon, and so on, until the player has "unlocked" all the characters. Each match consists of a single-round. A defeated player may elect to resume play by using a continue. In two-player mode, all characters are immediately available to either player and each match is the best of three rounds. Players can also select a handicap level (from 1 - 5) to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game.</desc>

The gameplay of The Humans has similarities to Lode Runner and Lemmings. Your job in this action puzzler is to help prehistoric man to evolve by helping them discover tools, the wheel, weapons, or even fire. Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.

Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.</desc>

The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.

Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 'influence' a license of a show about brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.

In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.</desc>

Two buttons are used to control the ball, one for normal actions and one for "Hyper Plays", special attacks that can only be learned and used in the Hyper League. How a player will block or attack depends on the ball's speed and the players position. Team members who aren't under the player's direct control will also act on their own by positioning themselves or preparing spikes. They will, however, not block spikes on their own but it is possible to let players not under direct control block spikes by pressing one of the action buttons at the right moment.</desc>

Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over.

		<desc>A golf game featuring four different game modes. The four game modes are Skins game, Match play, Stroke play, and Tournament.
The Skins game has players compete for prize money on each individual hole.
Match play involves 2 golfers competing to see who can win the most holes out of 9 or 18 holes.

Stroke play counts the total number of strokes over a course of a golf game. The golfer with the least amount of strokes wins.

Tournament mode has golfers competing in either one day (18 holes) or two days (36 holes) of golf. Scoring is figured out by how many strokes over or under par a golfer made to finish a hole.

Gameplay consists of first choosing a golfer type of either a power hitter, all-around, technician, or magician. Each type has its own proficiencies in the drive, power, accuracy, hook, slice, and back spin categories.

When on the golf course the player can choose a club, their stance, direction of where to hit the ball, and the power of the swing. Once that is decided, the swing is determined by a meter which measures the accuracy of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices.</desc>

		<desc>Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings is the official game of the mascot of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his world.

The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.

Graphics and sound remain faithful to the cartoony origins of the mascot.</desc>

		<name>J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings - Volume One (Europe)</name>
		<desc>J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings - Volume One is a video game adaptation of the famous book, which is quite different from the computer game of the same name.

The events that occur in the game roughly correspond to those depicted in the first volume of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, though the game ends before the final chapters of the first book. The player takes control of Frodo Baggins, who must find companions for his quest. The game's locations, individual objectives, missions, and quests are structured quite differently from those of the computer release. Most of the quests involve retrieving items for various NPCs, thus advancing the narrative.

The gameplay is also different from the computer version, being less heavy on character development (role-playing), and more oriented towards combat, which is action-based in this release. Though up to three characters join Frodo on his quest, one player can control only one character at a time. Multiplayer has been therefore added to the game, with up to four players controlling the characters in the party simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>This adaptation of the animated TV series differs significantly from its NES namesake. The nephew of Agent 007 must foil the plans of malevolent S.C.U.M. agents, who are hunting for rare artifacts that would allow them to dominate the world. Unlike the NES game, this version is a more action-oriented side-scrolling game without detailed mission objectives or puzzle-solving.

The game consists of three levels, each beginning with a section in which Bond pilots a helicopter, a boat, and a jet, respectively. These are controlled in arcade-like fashion, similarly to side-scrolling shooters. Enemies must be dealt with using weapons mounted on the craft. Various hazards are scattered through the stages, requiring the player to react quickly in order to stay alive.</desc>

He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies and obstacles. He can jump and he can launch a large fist from his stomach (he is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block so that he is unable to move for several seconds.</desc>

		<desc>George Jetson was about to run out to work when his pal Captain Zoom appears out of thin air. Zoom tells him that Zora, the leader of SPREE ("Space Pirates Revelling in Evil Enterprises"), is planning on looting this solar system of all its resource! Unfortunately, in his last encounter with Zora, Zoom has used up all his strength and now he is powerless so he asks George to take over. He gives George his Pneumo Osmatic Precipitator (or P.O.P.) and bids him good luck.  Can George save his family and this galaxy?

Guide George through 9 stages of intergalactic action armed with only his wits and the P.O.P....which is like a super vacuum. The P.O.P. can be used as a traveling tool by sucking onto walls and ceilings, it will enable George to climb up and across platforms.  As a weapon, the P.O.P. can be used to suck up blocks or enemies and spit out at other enemies. George can also use the P.O.P. to breathe under water! Talk about multi-functional!

George's conditions are indicated by the number of hearts he has at the top of the screen.  By collecting more hearts, it will refill George's health. Food items will increase your score and by getting a high enough score in each stage, you may get to play a bonus game.</desc>

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player's ultimate goal is to escape the Jurassic Park island. To reach that goal, several other tasks must be completed, including restoring power to the park and destroying a Velociraptor nest.

The large game world is seen from a top-down view and can be freely explored. Some areas are not accessible from the beginning, however. To enter them, keycards must be found or some special goal be completed, like rebooting the computer system and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can defend himself against the many free-roaming dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas grenade launcher and bola gun. All weapons except the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at the bottom of the screen helps in detecting approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once the park's motion detectors have been activated.</desc>

The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.</desc>

Josephine's psychic powers are shown on a bar and recharge gradually at a steady pace, changing color as they do. Depending on the color, an attack done will use up the current psychic energy and let loose a stronger attack, usually a projectile. Additionally, Josephine can summon flames around herself during a rush attack, at the cost of some energy. The game lasts seven levels, with a boss finishing off each level.</desc>

In the game there are four competitions (World Cup Finals, League, Knock Out Cup and the challenge). There is several options for game speed and ball control to suit both novice and skilled gamers. Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has "key players", such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation. The difference is that in the Arcade mode you can switch of rules to focus purely on reflexes.</desc>

		<name>King Arthur &amp; The Knights of Justice (USA)</name>
		<desc>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, King Arthur and the knights of Camelot have been encased inside glass by Morgana Le Faye. Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.

King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.</desc>

As per usual in golf games, the more strokes it takes you to complete the whole, the lower your score - so make sure you aim Kirby just right!

You'll find eight courses and a total of sixty-four holes in the game, not including the final showdown with King Dedede, as well as an action-packed two-player mode.</desc>

The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.

When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.</desc>

		<name>Lawnmower Man, The (Europe)</name>
		<desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

To complete your quest, you must fight your way through numerous enemies using different combinations of slashes and kicks. You cannot perform any throws, but there are different magic attacks and a special attack. The special attack is a ranged attack that consumes a certain amount of energy, whereas the different spells use up magic bags that can be found throughout the game and damage every enemy on screen. Defeated enemies drop different kinds of items such as magic bags , food to replenish your health, money and keys that are used to open treasure chests in some of the bonus-games that take place in-between battles. Naturally, at the end of each stage, a powerful boss is waiting to be defeated.</desc>

		<desc>Goemon (Kid Ying) and Ebisu-Maru (Dr. Yang) are enjoying themselves at home, when they hear about strange spirits sighted at the temple and taking control of the other villagers. Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!

Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.

At the end of each village is an "action area" which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.</desc>

Each level comprises both destructible landscape elements such as rocks, indestructible sections such as steel plates, and numerous obstacles including chasms, high walls, large drops, pools of water or lava, and booby traps. Each level also includes one or more entrance points and one or more exits. The goal is to guide a certain percentage of the green-haired, blue-shirted lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use.</desc>

In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).</desc>

However, Looney Tunes is much more informal and silly, though this level of silliness is set by the player via the Wackiness Meter on the main menu. Players choose their teams from the likes of: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, Tasmanian Devil, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam and Marvin Martian. Each player has unique statistics for their shooting, 3-pointers, defense, stamina and speed.

Once on the court, the player can pass the ball, shoot the ball, grab a burst of speed or unleash a special defensive ability or a special offensive ability.. These abilities include cream pies, time bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun toys from the ACME Corporation. Offensive Abilities must be "bought" by collecting gems and other items which occasionally show up on the basketball court.</desc>

The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories. One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</desc>

		<name>Lost Vikings, The (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

Its events take place ninety-nine years prior to it, and it explains the origin of the series' antagonists, the group of super-humans known as the Sinistrals. The player controls the ancestor of the first game's protagonist, the swordsman Maxim. After having encountered a mysterious woman named Iris, Maxim goes on a journey to find other heroes who would help him to stop the Sinistrals from destroying the world.

Like the first game, Rise of the Sinistrals is a Japanese-style turn-based RPG with many puzzle elements thrown in. The game makes extensive use of puzzles in its dungeon layouts; various items and accessories must be used to solve them. It also features a "Capsule Monsters" system; monsters can be summoned to fight alongside the party in battles. They would evolve when fed weapons, armor, or special fruits. Unlike in the first game, there are no random battles in the dungeons: all the enemies are visibly moving on-screen.</desc>

		<name>Madden NFL '96</name>
		<desc>Madden NFL '96 is a football video game designed for the 1995 NFL season, licensed by the NFL. It features John Madden on the cover. The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency. Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create-a-Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player. The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret "classic" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-a-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the "superteams" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.</desc>

Only young Herras, who was at a friend's house at the time of the massacre, survived. Unbeknownst to him, the Dark Wing made an agreement that after the strike, they would separate for ten years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations.

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.</desc>

Thanks to the efforts of Mega Man and his friends, Dr. Wily was finally brought to justice. However, Wily had always known that he might be imprisoned one day and so he had constructed four backup Robot Masters in a hidden laboratory, Burst Man, Cloud Man, Junk Man and Freeze Man. If they did not receive a communication within six months, they would begin searching for their master. After six months, the robots activate and go on a rampage throughout the city in which Dr. Wily is being held. Mega Man is called into action. Upon driving into the city with Roll and Auto, he sees that the it is in ruins and that he is too late to stop Wily's Robot Masters from liberating the evil scientist. Mega Man gives chase, but is stopped by Bass, a robot with capabilities much like Mega Man's own and his robotic wolf Treble. After a brief skirmish, Mega Man is informed that the two of them are battling Wily as well. Bass and Treble then take off, leaving Mega Man confused, but convinced that he has new allies and determined to again stop Dr. Wily's plans.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Mega Man X3 revolves around a Reploid scientist named Dr. Doppler. In the year 21XX, the threat of the Mavericks had been neutralized thanks to Doppler's technology, which prevented the Mavericks from going berserk. The reformed Reploids had formed a utopia near their new mentor called Doppler Town. It seemed that all was well, until the former Maverick Reploids suddenly reverted and once again began causing trouble. Dr. Doppler was held accountable, and X and Zero were sent out to contain the new threat. Once Zero and X defeat Dr. Doppler and his forces, Dr. Doppler snaps out of it and realizes all the damage that he has done. He reiterates that Sigma's true form is now a computer virus, and he realizes that he was corrupted to create a new body for him. X seeks out Sigma after thanking the doctor. After an intense battle, the Sigma Virus in its pure form chases X in an attempt to possess him. After X finds himself at a deadend, one of two things may happen. In the main ending, Zero takes Dr. Doppler's true antivirus and uploads it onto his sabre offscreen. He rushes in to save X just in time and causes Sigma to explode, taking out the lab as they evacuate. However, if Zero was injured during the game, the worse scenario occurs - Dr. Doppler instead uses his own body as the antivirus and sacrifices himself for the greater good.</desc>

		<desc>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.</desc>

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.</desc>

		<name>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Fighting Edition (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition is a game directly based on the world-known television series. In this game, you can choice among 8 playable characters: the Power Rangers' Zords (Thunder Megazord, Mega Tigerzord, Ninja Megazord, Shogun Megazord) or some of their known villains (Lipsyncher, Silver Horns, Goldar, Lord Zedd). The title offers 3 game modes: Story Mode (1-Player only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player only).

During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 Zords, the 4 villains up to Lord Zedd and last, but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can opt by the Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord (formed in conjunction with the White Ranger). The Fighting Mode is an traditional 2-Player head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of the 4 Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is a Endurance-like option, and the main goal is to win as many battles as possible using only 1 health bar (that will be partially replenished after each battle).

As well as many fighting games, you can take advantage of a Power Bar (here, it fills automatically): if you execute a Super Move when this bar is flashing, it will be cause more damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you having reached its maximum status, it's possible to execute power-up versions of Special Moves or even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).</desc>

		<desc>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.
When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.
Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.
Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.</desc>

Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

		<desc>NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and was also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.
A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an "on fire" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become "on fire" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while "on fire").</desc>

		<desc>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. 

The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.
A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.

Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.</desc>

Exhibition mode lets the player select a team and play either another player or the computer. The player can also select a demo mode where two computer controlled teams will face off against each other. The playoff mode features 12 teams competing for a chance to win the Super Bowl.

During the game, the field is mainly viewed from a horizontal perspective. Players select their plays (pass, run, or kick) and try to outscore their opponents by the time the clock runs out. After every quarter, the game updates the player to the current game statistics.</desc>

Other extras include multiplayer support for up to 8 players through network or Gravis's GrIP system, the option to create new players and trade them around, and the usual amount of EA sports licensed multimedia flair, including an interesting "Goalie Mask Viewer" which lets you observe the elaboratedly decorated helmets of 30 goalies.</desc>

Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures. The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.

As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.</desc>

Game modes include exhibition games (or "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties.

		<desc>Nickelodeon GUTS is based off of the Nickelodeon TV show in the late 90's that is basically American Gladiators for kids.  The events in the game are based off of the actual game show events with the main goal being to score as many points as possible while trying to beat the clock.

In Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced around.  There are three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, Attack is lacrosse and Spiral where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging tire.

Action Sports is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and is divided into two events:  Basic Training involves poles, swinging ropes and punching bags and Tornado Run which adds water jets and moving platforms.  Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and a chance at the bonus round.

The final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant indoor mountain the player must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents.  The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.

There is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event.  Elastic lets the players compete against each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be played through alternating play.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition (USA)</name>
		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.

During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</desc>

The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.

The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.</desc>

Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts. Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</desc>

		<name>On the Ball (Europe)</name>
		<desc>There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.

That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named "inertia."  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.

It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.

(Now if only someone could explain the "Camel" part - referencing the Japanese title.)</desc>

The dimensional fabric surrounding the facility seems weak and strange monsters have been sighted. Concerned, an unknown agency preps a cybernetic soldier and his weapons to investigate...

Playing as the bionic soldier, this game is a top-down shooter. The player must blast their way through enemy forces and the activate various switches to progress. Accessing computer memory banks throughout the facility will reveal footage of the accident and give some idea of all it happened. Additionally, dimensional holes have opened up all around the levels allowing monsters to appear and making certain paths, walls and technologies inaccessible until the area has been stabilized.</desc>

		<name>Operation Thunderbolt (USA)</name>
		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</desc>

		<name>Out of this World (USA)</name>
		<desc>Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America and Outer World in Japan, is a 1991 cinematic platformer designed and developed by Eric Chahi. Selling around 1 million copies in the 1990s,[2] Another World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in the graphics, sound and cut scenes, with characters communicating through their facial features, gestures, and actions only. This cinematic style granted Another World cult status amongst critics and fans.

Originally developed on an Amiga 500 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals.</desc>

		<name>Outlander (USA)</name>
		<desc>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.

The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.

Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Attack (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</desc>

The Peace Keepers is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to games in the Final Fight series. The player can choose from four characters (plus two that become available later in the game) with different strengths and weaknesses. In addition to combinations of standard attacks, jump-, run-  and throwing attacks, all characters can also block attacks, perform single heavy attacks, special attacks that consume a certain amount of energy and super attacks. Super attacks damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue. If a character is hit repeatedly, there is a chance that they temporarily switch into "angry-mode" during which they are invincible and more powerful. 

Most levels offer different paths and exits, and after every level, a different character may be selected. This means that levels may be played through in different orders and that it is not at all necessary to play through all the levels to reach one of several endings.</desc>

The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).

The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</desc>

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

Other controls include: blocking attacks, grabbing and throwing opponents, dash attacks while running, and a special attack that hits multiple enemies consuming life energy at the same time. Most levels also require you to avoid obstacles like chasms, falling rocks or spikes that shoot out of the ground.</desc>

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.</desc>

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies.</desc>

		<name>Prince of Persia 2 (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Similar to the first Prince of Persia, the character explores various deadly areas by running, jumping, crawling, avoiding traps, solving puzzles and drinking magic potions. Prince of Persia 2 is, however, more combat-heavy than its predecessor. In the first game, enemies appear only occasionally and are always alone, while in the sequel, up to four enemies may appear at once, sometimes flanking the player, and may even be instantly replaced by reinforcements when they are killed. As in Prince of Persia, the trick is to complete the game under a strict time limit that passes in real time. Lives are unlimited, but time cannot be regained except by reverting to a previously saved game. In other areas, more significant improvements have been made. The graphics are far more complex than the simple look of the game's predecessor, the areas explored are larger, and the variety of backdrops is greater.</desc>

		<name>Push-Over (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es)</name>
		<desc>You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.

Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.</desc>

The player's putty can stretch in a variety of ways: sidewards to cover ground faster, squash flat to absorb pick-up items, stretch upwards to climb, morph a fist to attack, or inflate to float upwards.

Putty can collect stars that increase his attack power: at first increasing the potency of his punch, but later allowing him to blow darts, electrocute enemies or throw bombs. This star power is reduced every time Putty is hit by an enemy.</desc>

		<name>Radical Psycho Machine Racing (USA)</name>
		<desc>RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90 turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.</desc>

While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</desc>

		<name>Redline F-1 Racer (USA)</name>
		<desc>Released in Europe and Japan under its original title, "Aguri Suzuki F-1 Super Driving" is a Formula One simulator for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Everything from treacherous right turns to gasoline is simulated as the player tries to win the FIA World Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. The player can play a single race (non-championship Formula One race) or a season mode where the winner takes all, and the losers can wait until next year.
 
The game allows players to customize their racing vehicle. Suspension, wings, and brakes among other things can be altered to gain lap times in addition to positions on the track. Winning is near impossible unless the player can successfully tinker with his vehicle from the beginning of the race week. Even the weather can betray the player; having the wrong tires will make the car skid out. The controls and overall gameplay are relatively simplistic for a driving simulator game. Aguri Suzuki even appears in the game as the most expert driver. The graphics in the game look like they come out of an 8-bit console system.
 
In 1993, Aguri Suzuki F-1 Super Driving was released for the Game Boy handheld, exclusively in Japan. In this game, the player can control a kart and a Formula One car.</desc>

The final stage is "Marooned" where the player takes control of Stimpy and is swallowed by a giant alien and must avoid various enemies as the fall down the throat of the giant alien.  Once Stimpy lands in the stomach, the player must make it to the end of the level, attacking enemies and avoid pits of acid in order to reach the end of the stage.

		<desc>This game comes at you with a Fantastic Voyage tale of a microsurgeon miniaturized to a near-microscopic scale in order to enter the body and save the life of a tobacco salesman, ironically laid low by health complications caused by the very cigarettes he sold. Rex must be asking himself, "My parents put a mortgage on their house to put me through eight years of medical school just so I could scrub tar off someone's lungs like a window-washer?" But it gets worse: Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting to silence the turnabout whistleblowing revelation they anticipate in the unlikely event of this salesman's recovery, have some shrinking technology of their own, and have introduced sinister nanobots into his body to ensure his -- and Rex's -- untimely demises.</desc>

Well, you might end up with something like Death Valley Rally. The object is pretty simple: Race the Road Runner through each level as quickly as you can while collecting different colored flags, which are worth different amounts of points. When you reach the ending, if you're fast enough, you'll also get a time bonus, but if you're good enough, you'll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won't usually be able to find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers. You can run, turbo run (by stocking up on bird seed), peck, and jump in this wild adventure, as you try to catch the escape the ever-witty Wile E. Coyote and his assorted ACME contraptions.</desc>

The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball. 

The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.</desc>

He hopes to create new functions in nature that will remove the pollution from the Earth before it is too late. Unfortunately Dr. Bruford's experiments go wrong and genetic monsters are unleashed upon the world. The only thing that can stop these creatures are Dr. Bruford's previous achievement: Genetically enhanced warriors known as the Run Sabers. Two of the Run Sabers, Sheena and Allen are ready to activate.

Run Saber is a side-scrolling platform game similar in gameplay to Strider. Players assume the role of one or both of the Run Saber characters. Choosing either Sheena with her Ice powers or Allen with his Thunder powers, players must defeat mutant monsters. The Run Sabers can move side to side, jump in the air, attack with a sword, climb along walls or roofs, slide across the ground and drop-kick. Additionally, each character has a special move, which damages everything on the screen with either Ice or Lightning, and which can be activated by collecting orb power-ups. Other power-ups include small health, large health, extra life and a larger sword. Players progress through 5 different levels, often encountering powerful boss and miniboss mutant creatures.</desc>

		<desc>Your name is Kevin Codner  rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.

There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.

Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.

At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.</desc>

Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right
Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.
Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport
Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</desc>

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right, jump and swing Skljagger's magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests, boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.</desc>

		<name>SOS (USA)</name>
		<desc>The date is Tuesday, September 13th, 1921.  It's a stormy night, and the luxury ocean liner "Lady Crithania" is about to be capsized by an enormous wave.  Many of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the sinking ship before it floods entirely.  Will you?

Inspired by Paul Gallico's 1969 novel The Poseidon Adventure, this game puts the player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher, architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell, doctor.  Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct backstories and motivations -- a successful strategy toward winning the game will vary greatly depending on which character you initially select to play.  And just how is the game won?

Here's a hint: don't be on the ship when it goes down for the last time.  Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its platform-game spiritual predecessors Prince of Persia and Flashback: exploring and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well as many of the gradiated permutations between -- thanks to dizzying Mode 7 abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable (and predictably inconvenient) intervals, granting access to some hitherto unreachable areas (those doors at floor level are of little use when you're on the ceiling!) while denying access to other portions of the ship you perhaps intended to go back through.  You're going to need to recognize where you can and can't -- yet -- reach, and make a note to revisit when the pendulum swings the other way.

You're not going to make it out on your own.  A successful evacuation is going to require the assistance of other survivors.  Supposing you can find ( -- and reach!) them, you're still going to have to safely lead them past obstacles and hazards (as the ship flip-flops on its way to Davy Jones' Locker)... and as with all NPCs, they're slower and less agile than you, necessitating plotting out the simplest, safest course possible (... given the circumstances.)  Which of the endings you conclude with will be determined by who you rescue and how many of them there are -- but I'm sure you'll have your hands full the first few dozen play-throughs just staying alive and trying to figure out how to get to where you're supposed to be going.

Did I mention there's a time limit of one measly hour?  For once, it's your friend; since your injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of 5 minutes from the time remaining -- but no matter how safe and dry a hidey-hole you manage to find, when the countdown reaches zero, it's game over.

Hope you packed a towel!</desc>

		<desc>Borf has kidnapped Dexter's girlfriend Kimberly and is threatening to turn earth's population into babies using his "Infanto Ray". Naturally, Dexter cannot let this happen and sets out to stop Borf and rescue Kimberly.

While following the same story as the Laserdisc conversions, the SNES version of Space Ace obviously lacks the long video sequences of the original, and also features different gameplay. 

Instead of only pushing the right button at the right moment, the player has complete control over Dexter. Most of the time, he will be busy jumping over chasms and dodging alien attacks, but occasionally, an 'energize'-symbol will appear which, by pressing the correct button in time, will temporarily transform Dexter into his stronger alter ego and enable him to shoot at his enemies.

Once he boards his space ship, Dexter has to find his way out of a labyrinthine seen from a top-down perspective, destroying obstacles with the ship's laser and avoiding collisions.

In order to retain the atmosphere of the original, the SNES version features a large number of (short) death animations and the platformer levels always follow the exact same sequence, which results in a trial&amp;error-style gameplay somewhat similar to the original.</desc>

The hovercraft has the ability to accelerate, reverse, track the hoverball, and it can also fire at the opposing player to make him drop the ball if he's carrying it. If the player's hovercraft picks up the hoverball, they must try to get to the touchdown area within four seconds or else the hoverball gets automatically fumbled. Each game is played for a duration of 500 time units and the player with the highest score when the time runs out is declared the winner.

The playfield itself presents features that can affect the way the match is played. Some playfields contain things such as jumps, spinners, and force arrows which can help or hinder a players movement. 

There are a total of 12 drivers to choose from, with 4 per every speed level (slow, medium, and high).</desc>

		<desc>Spanky's Quest is a game about a monkey who decides to go on a picnic.  While on his way through the forest he see's a witch in the sky and out of nowhere bricks begin to make a tower around the area Spanky is in.  The witch challenges Spanky to come to the final tower and she will free him but before she flies away she turns the fruits in his knapsack into living fruit monsters.  Unknowingly, she drops a magic ball which agrees to help Spanky out on his quest.

The object of the game is to get through all six of the towers which consist of 10 levels as well as a boss battle.  In order to proceed to the next level, you must acquire the amount of keys the locked door requires.  Keys are found lying around until a monster picks them up in which case you must use your ball on them to get it.  The ball has for different attacks: baseball, soccer ball, volleyball and basketball.  In order to attain a stronger ball, the ball must be bounced on Spankey's head.

He is armed with a sword that can fire energy bolts and a rocket pack that allows him to fly short distances. The gameplay remains mostly the same as in Mega Drive games, with the most notable change being the addition of a short-distance rolling dash. One major difference is that the game's final level depends on a difficulty player selected. On easy, the game culminates with battle against Axel Gear, but on normal, the story continues with Sparkster fighting the leader of the Wolves on the next level. On hard difficulty, the game continues beyond that, with the true final stage.</desc>

Only Slowpoke escaped and sent for his cousin, the fastest mouse in Mexico... Speedy Gonzales! Following the trail of the Bandidos, Speedy will enter each level and try to rescue as many mice as possible while chasing after cheese and avoiding natural hazards. Ariba! Ariba!

The gameplay in Speedy Gonzales resembles the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games more than anything else. For the most part Speedy will run, run across fields and up slopes and into tunnels. There are also mousetraps which function similarly to Sonic's trampolines and will propel Speedy into the air. Speedy has a short range kick for attacking and can occasionally pick up items and use them at a later time.</desc>

Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</desc>

		<desc>Street Hockey '95 is like ice hockey without ice and in urban environments with no-holds barred rules.  Instead of ice skates, roller blades are used as players can pick from nine different skaters and assemble their squad in a series of game modes.  There are five modes in all: Fat Point, Rush, Whack, Crammit and Hot Puck, each with their own rules, time-limit and scoring system (ex. Fat Point awards players different points by what kind of shot they scored the goal with).

There are six different environments to choose from ranging from empty swimming pools to construction sites filled with various obstacles that can stop the player dead in their tracks, but also has ramps so players can avoid the obstacles.  It also features multiplayer capabilities using an adapter to allow four friends to compete head-to-head.</desc>

During the 1 player game the player selects 1 of 13 fictional teams and plays the other 12 teams in a row. The overall goal, instead of just merely winning baseball games, is to play the perfect game and get a perfect rating. During a game, players start with an overall rating of a 100, and then after the game is finished game points are added or subtracted in 13 different rated categories such as number of errors made, the number of walks, pitched, number of times struck out, etc... The players final game points determines the difficulty level of their next opponent. The game has up to 5 difficulty rankings. Scoring a perfect 100 game points on a level 5 rated team will complete the game.</desc>

		<name>Super Battleship (Europe)</name>
		<desc>This game features two different modes of play: Classic Battleship and Super Battleship.

Classic Battleship is the typical Battleship game where the players set up their ships on a grid, then take turns choosing 3 places at a time to target and hope they hit the opposing players ship. The game ends when all the opposing players ships are sunk. This mode contains four difficulty levels: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, and Admiral.

Super Battleship involves eight levels consisting of sixteen missions total. Missions include sinking enemy ships in a certain number of rounds, escorting ships to their destinations, defending cities from attack, and destroying enemy airfields. Gameplay consists of a turn-based moving of ships utilizing an overhead view. The player can then target any enemy units within the ship's range and attack. Attacking brings up an action sequence where both ships trade volleys of gunfire until one of them either sinks or retreats.</desc>

If the player encounters and air resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine gun to cut down enemy choppers.

Players also have smoke screens that can temporarily make them unseen to any enemy forces, plus they can call in supply drops to replenish their armor and ammo as well as air support that can level any opposing force in their wake.</desc>

Bonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!</desc>

		<desc>Super Pang is an adventure for one or two players that takes the player around the world, aiming to rid the planet of a terrible foe: seemingly innocuous-looking bubbles. The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.

Players must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.

Several power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.

In addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.</desc>

Once again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they huddle against new nightmarish horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.
You must descend into Castle of the Undead and its gruesome ground, accompanied by the most chilling sound effects to ever tingle your spine. Inside, a freshly dug 11 levels maze features the treacherous Terrace of Terror, the dangerous Rotating Dungeon, the Sunken Ruins of Lost Spirits, torture chambers and creature filled caves.

All while dodging or destroying the unpredictable spitting lizards, carnivorous coffins, and more.
Find the concealed weapons needed to defeat everything from eerie phantoms to haunted furniture. Then prepare to find yourself face-to-thing with hideous torments like the Tongue Lasher, the Darkest Knight, the Bone-Afide Horseman and the Granite Crusher. When your nerves get shot, use your password and take a breather. But forge on, Simon Belmont, because if you though Dracula was down for the count, he's only just begun to fright!</desc>

		<desc>Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.

But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.

Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.

When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.</desc>

There are also cities, airports, and shipyards, which you can occupy and use for your own purposes (ie. to repair a unit).

		<name>Super Godzilla (USA)</name>
		<desc>Super Godzilla is a 16-bit Godzilla game where the player can take control of Toho's famous big green lizard as they rampage through Japan.  The game is divided into two main gameplay modes, Movement and Battle.  Movement has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups.  There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.

Battle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster.  However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks.  Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.</desc>

		<desc>Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due to a malfunction on Dr Krankenpot's new teleport machine (how come characters with German-sounding names in computer games and films are always evil or stupid? Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.

The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress.</desc>

		<name>Super Ninja Boy (USA)</name>
		<desc>Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears. A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.

The game contains familiar role-playing elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells, as well as activate various bonuses on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.

When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack and Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.</desc>

There are six modes to choose from: Exhibition, Home Run Derby, Defense Practice, Playoffs, League, that has the player compete against each team in the game in succession and Game Breaker which lets the player choose from 17 scenarios to win the game under certain conditions.  They can also choose different Division Champion line-ups that range from 1989-1993 or All-Star Lineups from 1989-1994.

The graphics of the game are presented in a cartoonish-way and the stadiums are "authentic", but altered to distinguish themselves from the actual MLB stadiums.  The game doesn't feature a battery back-up like many other baseball games, but Series championships can be saved using passwords.  Jack Buck also lends his voice talent to the game calling play-by-play commentary.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Super Star Wars - Return of the Jedi (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi follows closely the standard set by the first two Super Star Wars games, with the return of selectable characters (on specific levels), multiple playable characters and Mode 7 quasi-3D vehicle sequences. The controls are identical to the second game, and this installment also includes its predecessor's password save option. It loosely follows the plot of Return of the Jedi, although some of the levels aren't seen in the film at all, such as Luke Skywalker having to fight through the Death Star to get to Emperor Palpatine. In addition to the standard Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca, new playable characters include Princess Leia Organa (in Boushh, Slave, and Rebel uniforms) and Wicket the Ewok. Bosses include the Jabba the Hutt's Palace door droid, the Rancor beast, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. Vehicle sequences include the Endor speeder bike chase, and a cruise in the Millennium Falcon. Luke Skywalker no longer has 9 Force Powers to work with but 5 and it is easier for him to "recharge" his abilities. He also cannot use any variation of the blaster in this game. Interestingly, Darth Vader is far easier to beat in this game than in Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. The final boss in the game is Emperor Palpatine, who is unforgivingly difficult as he is able to levitate and shoots lighting all over the throne room, annihilating platforms and walkways. The final levels detail the attack on the Second Death Star's main reactor.</desc>

Unlike the original game, this installment allows each character the use of a primary and secondary weapon. Following one of the Dagobah missions, Luke Skywalker can also collect Force Powers for use in later levels. Darth Vader appears as the final boss in the video game.</desc>

With the promise of permanent world peace finally at hand, only a madman would still harbor dreams of world domination. Such a madman is the dictator of Sovinia, a small but cunning rebel nation.

"In his insane lust for power, he has joined forces with a huge, hostile war force from beyond this planet, armed with weapons more powerful than anything ever seen before by man. The Allied Countries of Earth try to resist, but without nuclear weapons, their efforts are futile. By 2008, most of the planet lies in ruins; then, in an ironic twist of treachery, the alien forces turn against their ally, and set out to complete their conquest and colonization of Earth

"Now, with the survival of the human race at stake, the allied countries join forces with the rebel dictatorship in a last-ditch effort to drive out the invaders. At their secret fortress deep in the Amazon Jungle, the greatest scientists of Earth carefully analyze the alien weaponry, and develop the weapon to end all weapons: Strike Gunner. With time running out, and few resources remaining, only two can be built; but those two can combine at will into one superfighter of astonishing power. With an awesome arsenal of offensive and defensive devices at your command, and your own unmatched courage and skill as a fighter pilot, the Earth may yet be saved</desc>

Similar to it's predecessors, Super Turican features large levels that are crammed with secrets and can be explored freely and in any direction. To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.</desc>

		<desc>Super Turrican is back, and once again the USS Freedom Forces have to prevent the evil Machine from harming innocent civilizations. 
This requires the player to jump and shoot his way through large levels filled with lots of enemies. To get rid of all the enemies, several different weapons can be used, most of which are already familiar to players from previous installments of the series: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to go
into "wheel-mode" for a limited time to become invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest difference to previous Turrican-games however, is the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of the levels are strictly linear and don't feature any large secret areas that have become somewhat of a trademark of the series.</desc>

But he was too weak to control the power of the ring, and became possessed by it. The mad prince was sealed into a crystal, but many years later managed to break out, planning to wreak havoc on the Dream World and to conquer it! Yuko, the heroine of the three previous Valis games, is no longer a sacred Valis warrior - she has become a goddess. Lena, a young girl who wants to become a Valis warrior, is the new main character, who must prove to Yuko she is worthy to wield the sword of Valis, that will eventually stop the evil plans of Gallagher.

Like the previous games in the series, this is an action platform game. You can fight enemies with melee weapons or use magic. In order to cast magic spells, you must gather special items while fighting off regular enemies. At the end of a level, a boss enemy battle awaits you. The game features cut scenes with anim-style graphics to advance the story.</desc>

Far off in the Horsehead Nebula, a group of shapeshifting aliens known as World Watchers assign planets for their Watchers to protect.  A purple alien, Widget, is an apprentice assigned with the job of protecting Earth.  Along for the ride is his intelligent sidekick, Mega Brain.

Super Widget is a platform game for the Super Nintendo, based on the cartoon show, Widget.  It shares some similarities to the game Felix the Cat in how the main character upgrades their weapon as they collect more power-ups.

Widget navigates through various worlds as he travels to Earth, picking up 'W' coins - 100 earns him an extra life.  There are also special power ups in different categories - these allow Widget to transform into a variety of different creatures, each with their own different ranged attack.  As the player collects more power-ups of the same type (up to three), they change into more powerful creatures.  If the player gets hit while transformed, they change back to the previous creature.  If they get hit while as normal Widget, they lose a life.

At the end of each world is a boss character.  These are larger enemies that require learning their basic pattern, avoiding their attacks, and then firing back with your own.  After defeating the boss, the player is graded based on how long it took to complete the level and their combat skills.  They are then awarded 'Watcher Experience' based on these grades.</desc>

Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.</desc>

It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</desc>

		<desc>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</desc>

The goal of the game is to travel down the road, collecting Kiwi's before the timer runs out, avoiding obstacles along the way.  The Kiwi's will get harder to catch as the game goes on, jumping over Taz and actually outrunning him at times.

Some obstacles Taz faces are trees, telephone poles, tour buses, even pterodactyls who will bring Taz back at the beginning of the level, but also have to avoid characters such as Axl &amp; Bull, a pair of gators who try to capture Taz for the zoo, The She-Devil who is in love with Taz and if the player is caught by her, the game is instantly over and Wendal T. Wolf, who will jump on Taz's back and cover the screen with his hands making it hard to see.

You can avoid some obstacles by using Taz's tornado spin, but using the spin will cause Taz's health meter to drop, but it can be refilled by eating Kiwi's along with blue and red birds, bushrats and items thrown to Taz by Didgeri Dingo, but beware, he can also throw obstacles at Taz as well including T.N.T.  There is also a bonus stages after completing three levels in which you collect as many items you can in the allotted time to raise the score.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - Tournament Fighters (Europe)</name>
		<desc>The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called "Cyber-Shredder" here).

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to rescue April and Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

		<desc>Sunday evening. You're sitting around the sewer watching your main reported, April O'Neil do a live remote from the Statue of Liberty. Then it happens. A humungoso flying android screams out of the sky and rips Lady Liberty from her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below. "No way!" cries Raphael. "Way," replies Donatello. And the crazy quantum chase is on!
Journey through ten levels of enormous arcade graphics, the largest and craziest talking Turtles ever with eons of bodacious battlegrounds, from prehistoric to futuristic galaxies. To prepare for the toughest Shred-heads you've ever seen, try the Versus mode, a Turtle-on-Turtle combat arena that finally proves who's the mightiest mutant of all. Also test your slice-em-up speed in the Time Trials mode to find out how fast you can clear three courses.
Get ready for the 3-D jab and toss that sends enemies flying right in your face. Mondo body slams and pizza power bonuses make you more Turtle than ever before. You better believe you're going to need it. Shredder's out for Turtle hide. And he's got all the time in the world to get it.</desc>

		<name>Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Europe)</name>
		<desc>One of the several games based on the eponymous movie. The player controls the T-800 terminator, a cyborg from the future, who travels to the year 1995 to protect John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against machines, from being killed by another terminator, the highly advanced model T-1000. 

This adaptation of the movie is essentially a side-scrolling action game, with both melee combat and shooting; there are also driving sequences between the side-scrolling levels, which mainly consists of avoiding pursuers and safely arriving to the next destination. T-800's default weapon is a pistol, but he can later acquire other weapons such as a shotgun, a mini-gun, etc. The "good terminator" can also use kicks and punches to dispose of the enemies. As in the movie, T-1000 appears frequently and must be fought and incapacitated, but can not be permanently killed until the ending part.

Another objective the player must complete is collecting various robotic parts that could lead to a construction of a new terminator. These parts must be sought out and destroyed, to make this new technique impossible.</desc>

The game has two kinds of levels: in several scrolling platform levels, Reese runs and jumps, shooting at Terminators (in the future war level that begins the game), street punks or policemen.

The film's chase scenes are recreated in two driving sequences. Viewed from behind, Reese and Sarah must escape the Terminator's pursuit in their car, dodging incoming traffic and avoiding the Terminator's fire.</desc>

He has grown up in his little village, isolated from the outer world by a stream of lava, and has never seen anything else beside it. One day, he and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming from beyond a door the village elder forbade them to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark damages the balance between two co-existing worlds, and all the village people are turned into stones. Now Ark has to embark on a dangerous journey - to find five Towers, and to seek there the answers to his questions, and to liberate his people from a terrible curse.

Terranigma is an action game with RPG elements. Ark levels up after having completed an important quest or cleared out an area. He can attack enemies with various weapons, using various techniques: pierce, leap, dash, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.

In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or "line" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).

In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).</desc>

Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</desc>

		<name>Tetris Attack (Europe) (En,Ja)</name>
		<desc>In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a colored block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching colors by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line).

Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send "garbage blocks" to the other player's playfield.

Tetris Attack provides several single-player modes. Story Mode takes the player through the game's main plot, pitting the player against a series of foes in a head-to-head match. The objective is to cause the computer-controlled player to lose. In Endless Mode, the player is challenged to play as long as possible with a continuously rising stack of blocks, which increases in speed over time. Timed Mode challenges the player to score as many points as possible within a two-minute time limit, and Stage Clear mode takes the player through a series of stages in which the objective is to clear blocks below a set line. A Puzzle Mode is also provided, which presents the player with a number of puzzles where he or she must clear all of the blocks in a set number of moves (Blocks do not rise in this mode).

In addition to the game's single-player modes, Tetris Attack also provides several multiplayer modes that are essentially two-player variants of the single-player modes. One or both human players may be substituted with a computer-controlled player with a selectable difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.

The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.</desc>

The player has two bars; one is the life bar and a bar that allows the player to perform special attacks (invisibility, gun play, speed running, a dome shield that knocks out everyone who hits it). It also contains a driving stage where The Shadow battles Mongols on motorbikes (Maritech Labs), and roughly follows the plot of the movie.</desc>

This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.

The events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the James Pond series (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.</desc>

		<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

However, to ensure their success they send their army into Earth's past in hopes of avoiding any modern weapons and increase their chances of saving their planet.  However, Earth has learned of their evil plot and has developed a experimental time portal and has sent their own one man army to stop them.

The player takes control of Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh who has acquired a massive arsenal including pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers and many more heavy weapons and must travel through various time periods including Medieval times, prehistoric times, Ancient Rome and Egypt and even the distant future.  The gameplay is similar to Contra where the player advances through the stages, shooting at various enemies and collecting power-ups and must also avoid various traps and pitfalls scattered throughout the levels.

		<desc>Time Trax is based off of the 1993-94 sci-fi action series starring Dale Midkiff; you take the role of Darien Lambert, captain of the Fugitive Retrieval Section of Washington D.C. It is the year 2193 and your once high arrest record has started to decline sharply as routine trackdowns end in mysterious disappearances. It is discovered that noted MIT scientist Dr. Mordecai 'Mo' Sahmbi has been sending criminals back in time to 1993 using his invention the TRAX time machine, and has gone back himself. TRAX is captured by the police, and three guesses as to who is tasked with capturing the criminals and sending them back to 2193.

As Lambert, your primary targets in this game are neo-Nazi racist Sepp Dietrich and Sahmbi himself. You do have some equipment to help you: your supercomputer S.E.L.M.A. (Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive), disguised as an AT&amp;T Mastercard and whose holographic persona resembles a British nanny, and the PPT (Pellet Projection Tube), a weapon capable of stunning a human from periods of a couple of minutes to a few hours and can fire pellets that render humans transportable to the future, disguised a keyless car alarm remote. Also, you have the ability to "time stall" (this slows the speed of images reaching your brain, allowing you to react quickly) and your Mosh-Ti (an Occidental improvement of martial arts) skills to rely on if the situation gets dire.

You'll run through the alleys of the future, through the Smithsonian (circa 1993), ride a motorcycle and jet-ski, battle criminals atop a construction site, and do so much more until you've finally captured the two fugitives.</desc>

		<path>./Timecop (USA).smc</path>
		<name>Timecop (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film Timecop, this game acts as a sequel of sorts. We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the film, and challenges him to a "duel across time." Platforming action follows across multiple periods of history.

The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The "timing,", both in terms of controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through the entire game.

There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.

The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the "FBI... Get on it!" background theme in the first few levels.</desc>

		<desc>You play Buster Bunny, in a series of levels, featuring characters from the Tiny Toon Adventures cartoon.

Most of the six levels are platform levels, where Buster has a number of attacks to defeat the enemies he faces.  These include kicks and jumps, and a dash ability that lets you slide into enemies to defeat them, and also climb walls.

The fourth level is an exception, and consists of a game of (American) football, played with a simplified version of the rules.  The idea is simply to get a touchdown, while as usual progressing at least ten yards in four downs.  There are two plays: a running play, where you simply run as far as possible while avoiding the opposing team; and a passing play that starts with a pass that can gain you extra yards, but must be caught.

Between levels there are bonus games.  You spin a wheel to determine what game you play out of five available.</desc>

In the Championship mode, players choose from 1 of the 8 available boxers, and then compete against the other 7 boxers on the road to try becoming the World Champ. Players go toe to toe with their opponents in the boxing ring in 3 minute rounds. The boxers can throw hooks and jabs at each other with the sole intention to knock their opponent down to the canvas by draining all their energy by landing those punches. Each punch thrown costs the boxer some stamina which is indicated by boxing glove icons. If all the boxers stamina is drained, they can no longer throw punches for a little while until they gain some of their stamina back. After each fight is over, players go to the gym to train in various different exercises like skipping rope and bench pressing weights. These exercises increase the players boxer in various areas like speed and power.

Options include setting the number of rounds (from 1 to 10) and setting the difficulty level (novice, advanced, and expert).</desc>

		<name>Top Gear 2 (Europe)</name>
		<desc>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. 

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</desc>

These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens. 

Game play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.

As there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.</desc>

But is it really his handiwork, or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel the mystery while traveling to various locales, fighting Von Hesler's henchmen and picking up (CPU-controlled) companions along the way.

Spike McFang has three main methods of attack: by striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also heal his health or give his companions extra strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you're playing the sanitized North American version) to regain health. There are a total of four different hats that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, head-spinning plants and a plethora of other dangerous enemies.</desc>

		<desc>The Avatar is once again summoned to the land of Britannia and this time he has to investigate ritual murders that have occurred in the town of Trinsic. Meanwhile, a new philosophical/social doctrine is spreading through Britannia, promoted by the mysterious Fellowship. The story of this version of Ultima VII is essentially the same as in the original PC version. However, the dialogues have been greatly reduced and/or simplified. This applies also to the size of the game's cities and other locations, the amount of items to pick up, interior details, etc. Combat also underwent significant changes. The battles in this version are action-based; the player has to click on the enemy repeatedly to win. Unlike the PC version with its party management, the Avatar is traveling and fighting solo in this release.</desc>

After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

		<desc>The Franco family used to be one of the influential houses of Portugal. That is until the head of the family sailed out of a disastrous voyage to find the kingdom of Prester John. The disarray that followed brought about an end to the nobility of the Franco name. 100 years have passed and Portugal has prospered through it's sailing and trading empires. Young Leon Fanco wishes to restore his family's good name and make a name for himself as a sailor. At the heart of his ambition is the fair lady, Christiana, who is desired by the likely heir to the kingdom. Towards that end, Leon has been working hard to secure finances for his first ship. With the first step of his dream complete, Franco sails out with his father's good friend as first mate, you're off to find fame, adventure and fortunes out on the sea and in uncharted waters.

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies. A variety of hazards live at sea including storms, other ships, seaweed and simply bad winds and currents.</desc>

		<desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.</desc>

		<name>Uniracers</name>
		<desc>What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater?

It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.

The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...

Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.

Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.

Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers...</desc>

The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. 

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. 

Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</desc>

Something went wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.

War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place.</desc>

War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.</desc>

		<name>Wario's Woods (Europe)</name>
		<desc>Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.

There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.

There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the computer, but the "Round Game" mode features two modes of play: one that includes boss-fights on every level ending with a 9.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, Earth's temperature rises and melts the polar ice caps, and Earth lies under a watery grave.  Years later, survivors of this disaster live on boats or man-made islands called Atolls.  Everyone in this new world is looking for a mythical place called Dry Land, which people believe that there is a map to Dry Land on a little girl's back named Enola.  A band of pirates who live an oil tanker called the Smokers are after Dry Land and they are trying to get Enola for the tatoo on her back.  A nameless drifter who has adapted to the new world and this causes him to have gills and webbed feet, gets involved in this whole "quest for Dry Land" so to speak and becomes responsible for Enola and the woman who looks after her named Helen.

You play as the nameless drifter only known as The Marnier.  You play through three types of gameplay.  The first type of gameplay involves you sailing in a some-what big area and clearing the area of Smokers. There is a second type of these sailing levels add something else.  You can save the Atollers from The Smokers.  The second type of gameplay is the swimming.  You swim underwater avoiding sea creatures and collecting items for money to use at the shop after you kill off Smokers on the Atolls.  Killing of The Smokers is the third type of gameplay. You run through the Atolls with your big knife at first and then you get three more weapons along the way which are a pistol, a speargun, and a machine gun.</desc>

The gameplay is similar to many other hockey games with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs or even a "Just Play" option that instantly took the player to a random game.  There is also a "Simulation Mode" that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an "Arcade Mode" that was more action oriented and with less rules.

Xandra has all the abilities of a standard platformer character, which allow him to jump around and navigate the many obstacles found in the game. Additionally he's armed with a pitchfork which he can use to impale his enemies and stick to some surfaces. Collecting coins allow him to purchase extra lives, but there are no added weapons or spells as in the Valkyrie games.</desc>

The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren't always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you'd logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy this reduces the significance of the points system.</desc>

		<name>Wild Snake (USA)</name>
		<desc>WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a  confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.

The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).

The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.

The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.</desc>

The Secret Missions campaign adds 16 new missions to fly. Unlike the main game, there is no branching mission tree - progress is linear. There are also several new ships: a Confederation corvette, Kilrathi and Confederation freighters and of course the Kilrathi dreadnought with the secret weapon itself.

Characters from the main game can be transferred into the add-on, which also includes a "Mission Selector" to fly any of the missions from the original game.</desc>

If a mission is completed successfully, the player can power up the successful pilot in four skill categories: flying, shooting, mechanics, and stamina. A failed mission can lead to either a dishonorable discharge or death for the pilot.</desc>

The game is a platform adventure, which highly encourages exploration.  The action is split into four worlds.  In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a companion the witch must be fought.  After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different attacks and abilities.  Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as Toto also.

All levels can be revisited once passed and doing so required both for the purposes of stocking up on items and to find the Emerald City tickets which are required to enter the final area.</desc>

Occasionally bombs will fall which you may use to clear away a single letter or an entire stack of them, depending on the type of bomb. The larger the words you form, the higher points you receive. If you clear enough words without filling up the screen, you move on to the next level.</desc>

		<desc>Elite Soccer lets the player choose from 24 National teams including the U.S., England, France, Brazil among others, in a chance to play in the World Cup tournament and win the coveted trophy. Players can also choose to play in a Knockout-style tournament where instead of a round robin type of play like in World Cup, they instead play one game and advance to the next like a regular tournament. There is also a two-player mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head.

The main gameplay is the same as others with an overhead view with a third-person perspective for penalty kicks. The rules and regulations are up to date and can actually be changed to suit the players style of choice. They can also choose weather conditions, skills of goalies or even the choice to play either indoors or outdoors. Players can also edit their players including appearance and stats wise to suit their liking.

As well as the 24 teams who qualified for the tournament, other significant footballing nations like England, France and Denmark could be drafted in. The presentation of the menus is largely icon-based, with the official mascot featuring prominently. Tackling is difficult and passing is easy, making for a flowing end-to-end style of play.</desc>

		<desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</desc>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</desc>

Most levels are ended with a battle against a boss, which follows specific patterns and whose systems/weapons must be shot at and destroyed individually.</desc>

Raptor has unleashed an army of ruthless, mutating Morphs upon the city to enforce his brand of order. Only two special forces agents, Slash and Alix do not submit to Raptor's will. Raptor decides to hatch a plan to kidnap Alix, so Slash, and more importantly his magic X-Kaliber sword, will come to him in an attempt to try and rescue her.

The game consists of two modes. The first modes gameplay consists of side-scrolling action. The player can jump and swing a sword at enemies. The player can also deflect projectiles with the sword. The game also features one on one boss fights that are set up similar to a fighting game. The second mode is a two player duel that is set up like the one on one boss fights but is between two human controlled players.</desc>

		<desc>Because of a rise of anti-mutant activity in Genosha, Professor Xavier uses Cerebro to scan the island nation and discovers Apocalypse's presence there. Genosha's government is apparently using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate.

X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains.

Each character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations.

While most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress is saved via password.</desc>

		<desc>Xardion tells the tale of 3 warring planets that are home to 3 distinct alien races. Their fighting is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a much more potent alien race. The 3 planets find that they are able to set aside their differences long enough to battle their shared menace.

Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the threat. There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that one character receives a health refill.

Each character has special attributes that help the team. For example, Panthera's relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the other 2 characters can not travel. The characters can gather a number of unique powerups and weapons to help them on their mission.</desc>

Ys III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games, allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding.
