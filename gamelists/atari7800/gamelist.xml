		<name>Ace of Aces</name>
		<desc>Ace of Aces puts you in the cockpit of the Mosquito, the maverick RAF fighter bomber of World War II. It's white-knuckle aerial combat simulation, combining the exhilaration of flight with the gut-wrenching pressure of enemy confrontation.
During World War II, Mosquitos downed 659 enemy aircraft and 500 V-1 Buzz Bombs. Your only allies are your wits, your weapons, and your radar. Are you equal to the challenge?
Down the Nazi bombers, sink the U-boats, outrun the V-1 Buzz Bombs and stop the enemy trains to release the POWs. Should you fly through a storm or around? Navigate carefully, consult your intelligence reports and maps to make a decision. Choose your weapons and fuel wisely--once you're on a mission there's no going back.
Select one mission or any combination. If you complete all four successfully--and make it back alive--you'll become the most distinguished flight veteran of World War II--the Ace of Aces!</desc>

		<desc>Ballblazer is a simple one-on-one sports-style game bearing similarities to basketball and soccer. Each side is represented by a craft called a "rotofoil", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled "droid" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.</desc>

Grandpa has given you an Atari light gun to help protect the farm. The moving targets are a challenge. Can you hit them? If not, try the veggies! They're fun to shoot at.
In the barnyard, bottles and cans on the fence provide great practive for warming up the old shootin' iron. But perfect aim alone isn't enough. You'll need speed, too.
In the cornfield, birds swoop from the sky and rabbits scamper among the stalks, Owls and other pests appear inside a barn. Each scene can only be reached by hitting enough targest in the scene before. Once you zero in on some fancy shooting scores, Gramps offers you a bonus round by tossing target bottles in the air.</desc>

This premise kicks off Atari's action sports game for up to two players. The objective in Basketbrawl is to become the baddest gang in the town by winning the Basketbrawl tournament. To win, you must play three games against each of the five gangs in your city. Each time you move up to the next gang, you will play a team with more players and more dangerous weapons. Each game lasts six minutes -- out score you opponent by shooting more baskets. Each basket is worth two points. If the game is tied after six minutes, the first team to score wins</desc>

Super Joe is armed with a sub-machine gun (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades. While Joe can fire his gun in any of the eight directions that he faces, his grenades can only be thrown vertically towards the top of the screen, irrespective of the direction Joe is facing. Unlike his SMG bullets, grenades can be thrown to clear obstacles, and explosions from well placed grenades can kill several enemies at once.</desc>

		<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

Horrified, you get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site. But watch out, egg-stealing creatures are everywhere!</desc>

Your friends are lightly armed, but you carry your trusty crossbow.  By shooting its swift arrows, you can save yourself and your companions from the dangerous attacks of the Evil Master's creatures -- scorpions, ants, pterodactyls, voracious plants, bats, snakes, and other horrible beings.

When you reach the castle, the Evil Master's expert archers await you, ready to test their aim with deadly arrows.  Inside the castle, a fierce dragon also waits, guarding the treasure with its fiery breath.

Few adventurers have dared to make the trek.  No one yet has come back alive.</desc>

 Bruno the Sledge glares at you with his one remaining eye. When the bell rings, he charges like a man insane. Just before the impact of his 386-pound body, you step aside and raise your elbow.
 Perfect elbow smash! Bruno falls to the mat. You get him in a head lock, but his shaved head slips free. Then you see it. The famous Bruno the Sledge "Eye of Terror," the look of death. You're in trouble now!
 Mat Mania Challenge provides all the thrills and spills of professional wrestling. Do you have what it takes to survive brain busters and pile drivers? If you have the skills, the championship belt will be yours!</desc>

The annual MotorPsycho Competition (for deranged, psychopathic, and other unusual biker types) is this weekend!  Its obstacle-laden course is legendary among motorcycle maniacs.  Of course, nobody in their right mind would attempt this course.  The die-hard spectators remind you that fan is short for fanatic. They've staked out their favorite spots to view the races, and they are waiting for the roar of revving engines, the squeal of tires, the crunch of metal...

It's you against the clock and your bike is built for speed.  All you need to do is point it in the right direction and go for it!

Four different tracks will separate the veterans from the rookies.  (Or the schizophrenics from the psychotics.)  Weekend amateurs will eat your dust, but you've got some pretty insane competition from your fellow, uh, pros.  Some of these guys look hungry for the sweet taste of victory, but some of them look hungry for the taste of raw meat!

So rev 'er up and let 'er rip!  The winner's circle (or the guy with the clean white coat) awaits.</desc>

You knew your Master was a bit weird, but nothing prepared you for this! You must attempt to sneak in a birdie between karate kicks while you battle Ninja opponents. Par for this course means leaving the green littered with fallen foes.

You gain points for both your golf game and defeating attacking Ninja. You can also earn points for finding treasures and other bonus items along the course.

Once you've completed all nine holes successfully, be ready to challenge the disguised Master Ninja. This final battle will determine whether or not you become a Master Ninja. And if you win, it will improve your golf score.</desc>

In 2004 Curt Vendel of AtariMuseum.com uncovered several Atari 7800 prototypes, including the unreleased game Rescue on Fractalus. While the game is not complete, it is fairly far along, runs pretty smoothly, and can be played with the excellent MESS emulator. To start the game after firing it up, press "R" (Reset) in MESS. There is a glitch in the emulation right now with the rendering of your view outside the cockpit, but we expect this will be fixed in an upcoming release of MESS.</desc>

(The diet soft drink was because Louie was watching his weight -- nobody likes a fat junkyard guy.) The phone rang and Louie picked it up, even though his mouth was full. He listened a few moments, and then sprayed crumbs of bread and head cheese all over the office. A dastardly dognapper gang kidnapped his best pal Scraps, the infamous Scrapyard Dog! If Louie doesn't hand over the deed to the junkyard, Scraps is dog-gone!

Louie played along, and told the kidnappers he would bring the deed to the first checkpoint to receive further instructions. But it's un-American to knuckle under to kidnappers and terrorists, and Louie won't do it! He's going to go to the checkpoint and find out the location of the gang's headquarters, then he's going to rescue Scraps and rid the town of the puppy purloiners.

With a few useful items for weapons (mostly old cans), Louie sets out to save his buddy Scraps. Can Louie save his cruelly captured canine, or will little Scraps end up dog meat? Find out, and help Louie save his Scrapyard Dog!</desc>

Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun. When an energy source is hit, a beam blasts out from the Sentinel, strikes the target with hissing force, and draws energy back into your Sentinel. It's up to you to protect the Sentinel as it glides over the planets.

This was the only game for the 7800 that was originally released in PAL format only. Thanks to ResQsoft, an NTSC version is also available for gamers in the Western Hemisphere. Sentinel is a light gun game that is similar to Crossbow in the aspect that you are in charge of protecting your ally, in this case the Sentinel, from attack. The game features four stages, each which its own name and level boss. What makes the game unique is that shooting the large orange Sentinel acts as a smart bomb, destroying everything on the screen. While Sentinel is a very hard title to find in the wild in the Americas, this game is pretty common in Europe and can normally be purchased through online auctions at a reasonable price.</desc>

		<name>Tank Command</name>
		<desc>Tank Command is a vertically scrolling action game. You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game!

The 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well. Tank Command was only released in NTSC format.</desc>

Mad Dog growls and grabbing from behind drags Skin Head across the ring whipping him around in an airplane spin;  letting go so he flies into the ropes and bounces back to meet Mad Dog's concrete forearm across his neck...a perfectly executed clothesline.  

Wasting no time Mad Dog elbow drops him. Skin Head's face winces in pain as he fights his way up and staggers to his corner to tag his partner in.  

Big Chief takes the tag, grabs Mad Dog lifting him over his head and body slams him into the mat.  Mad Dog's stunned, he's not getting up.  Big Chief, looking for the pin, climbs the ropes for a dive.  

As he lunges into the air, Mad Dog scrambles to his feet and Big Chief's 
sweaty red skinned body splatters on the empty mat.</desc>

		<desc>Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.

Your cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!

The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.

Taking off and landing however, also requires additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try not to run over him...yet).

Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>

		<desc>In Water Ski you are water skiing on the Pharonna River. You control both the boat and skier in this vertically scrolling action game. Your goal is to reach the finish line before time runs out and also to earn as many points as possible. The river is quite dangerous, and features many twists and turns along with rocks, logs and other obstacles. For bonus points there are numerous ramps located throughout the river which your skier can jump over (and if you can manage to ski over every ramp on the level, you'll earn even more points!). You start the game with four skiers, and the game ends when all of you skiers have crashed.</desc>

This is it -- your chance to go for the gold!</desc>

		<name>Xenophobe</name>
		<desc>Hostile aliens - Xenophobes - are infesting space stations vital to your planet's security.  These aliens threaten to overrun the stations, rendering the space stations useless.

You are part of an elite team who is ready to speed to these endangered space stations.  Your mission is clear: destroy the aliens, regain control of the space stations, and pick up any valuable hardware you might discover as you sweep the stations for aliens.

The aliens are a swarming band of uglies, straight out of your worst nightmare. You'll need to use your talent just to stay alive as you rid each space station of these pests.  You don't want to let them catch you.  It's them or you.

The message has come.  It's up to you and your teammates to cleanse each space station of aliens.  Your Mother Ship brings you to the vicinity of each overrun space station.  You then enter the space station via a transfer disk.

Team up with another member of your elite squad, or work on your own to clear the aliens from an infested space station.  Just be careful as you enter a space station.  The aliens are everywhere!</desc>

		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>It's a nightmare, but it's true! Research shows that we are the actual aliens on Earth, and the ruthless Xevions are the original inhabitants.

Now the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.

Our puny weapons offer no defense. Earth's only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission: Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.

The mission is dangerous. We can't guarantee success. But at this point, it's do or die!

One small problem. We still need a pilot. Any volunteers?</desc>
