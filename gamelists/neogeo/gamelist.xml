		<name>3 Count Bout</name>
		<desc>3 Count Bout is a one-on-one fighting game. Choose from ten wrestlers who have their own power attacks. There are ten rounds in the game, and each one of them has you fighting other wrestlers that are much tougher than the previous ones. You defeat each one by biting, kicking, and performing other moves to the point where their damage meter is empty. But just because it is empty doesn't mean that you win. You have to pin him for the infamous-three count. Also features competitive play and tag match battles.</desc>

		<name>Aggressors of Dark Kombat</name>
		<desc>Aggressors of Dark Kombat is another one-on-one street fighting beat 'em up from the Neo-Geo's seemingly endless library of fighters.

It pits 8 fighters of different styles and strengths against each other in a tournament to see who's the toughest mofo on the streets of Tokyo. Your objective as usual is to deplete your opponent's health bar within the time limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks.

Unique to Aggressors of Dark Kombat is the combination of traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement. Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.</desc>

		<desc>Yuri Sakazaki has been kidnapped! Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

But not everything is as simple as it looks... because Robert is not the only one looking for Freia.

		<name>Battle Flip Shot</name>
		<desc>Although the game is largely a Pong clone, it does introduce several twists to the gameplay. Players are depicted as humans wielding large shields rather than the "paddles" alone. The setting consists of various futuristic arenas; the game takes place in the first half of the 22nd century. The ball cannot leave the play area upon reaching the left or right edge of the screen, as those are also limited by walls, in addition to the typical upper and lower wall. Instead, there are single columns of targets located along both the side walls. Whenever the ball hits a target, it is eliminated and points are scored by the opponent of the targets' owner. In order to win a round, the player must direct the ball by deflecting it with his/her shield so that all of his opponents' targets are eliminated while retaining at least one of his own targets. The duration of rounds is also limited by time; in the event that time expires before one of the sides manages to achieve victory, the side with the most targets left in play is declared the winner of the round; should this result in a draw (when both players have an equal amount of targets left), both sides are awarded a win.</desc>

		<desc>Sometime in their past, the planets Remuria and Mutras started an interplanetary war that showed no sign of ending. The endless fight between the human-like inhabitants of the two planets had gone so long that weapon development moved into dangerous territory: Organic Weapon Production combined with alien technology. Soon, a sentient weapon - Brawshella - was born. Brawshella gathered all animal life on both planets and forced them to do its bidding and attack the humans. In a week, the humans were assimilated by Brawshella.
Yet, once they were assimilated, they found no other purpose in life but to continue fighting each other. After a while, four of the assimilated fighter pilots regained their consciousness and remembered their pasts. Upon discovering their humanity, the pilots were conflicted with following Brawshella's orders or fighting it to fully regain their independence. The pilots finally turn against the machine in a battle to rediscover themselves and reclaim their planets.</desc>

		<name>Blue's Journey</name>
		<desc>The planet Raguy was once a beautiful place, until the evil Daruma tribe invaded, bringing pollution that corrupted the land. You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman: Panic Bomber</name>
		<desc>It is a "falling blocks" puzzle game based on the Bomberman franchise. The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects. You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent's field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.</desc>

		<desc>Somewhere in Hong Kong, two martial artists face each other in a vast courtyard. The challenger is a stout man in brown skin. The ground has been tainted with blood. However, his crescent blade hasn't touched his opponent yet. It was a one-sided battle. He was already exhausted and it won't be long before he would fall. "Fool, you will become one of my family" resounded the opponent's voice, as the challenger crumbled to the floor and was turned into sand.
The Fighting Instinct Tournament, or FIST, is a tournament as fierce as its name suggest. There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.</desc>

		<desc>Two years after the release of Breakers, Visco has come up with Breakers Revenge. This game is essentially the original Breakers with one new character, bringing the playable total to nine. This game, like Breakers, is a 2D side view fighting game. The two novel ideas from Breakers, having alternate names when characters fight their clones and having shadow images around a dizzy character, are also present in Breakers Revenge. But while they were mildly novel in the first game they barely merit a raised eyebrow in this.

Like its predecessor, Breakers Revenge plays like a standard Capcom inspired 2D fighting game. Characters have access to a variety of standard and special attacks, as well as combos, guard breakers, and taunts. Each time the character attacks his or her super meter is charged up, to a maximum of three levels. Whenever the super meter has at least one level charged the character can use his or her super attacks, which drain one level of the meter in the process. If the meter is allowed to charge up to the maximum three levels without being used all of the character's attacks become more powerful.</desc>

But it didn't stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called "The Knight of the Journey" came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities. After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight's progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.</desc>

		<desc>Cyber-Lip is a horizontally scrolling, side-view platformer shoot 'em up (this combination is sometimes referred to as "run and gun") arcade game released by SNK in 1990 for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS. The player(s) control(s) Rick and/or Brook, two human veteran soldiers, who are sent by an unspecified "federal government" into combat on a last-ditch attempt to save Earth from a malfunctioning military supercomputer in charge of all military androids. Gameplay consists of battling through large amounts of enemies, collecting power-ups and defeating several end-of-stage bosses. This makes it comparable to the likes of Metal Slug or Contra in terms of gameplay.

It is noted that a handful of members from Irem developed this title and later went on to create Metal Slug.

The game was later ported over for the Neo Geo CD system, in 1995. The CD featured improved voice acting and added a short introduction to the game explaining the plot.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>The game plays like a conventional fighting game of its time, that is battles are one-on-one and conducted on best two-out-of-three matches. One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the "charge meter", which is overlaid on the character's remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. "Charge moves" are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one.

The characters and stages are inspired by the Double Dragon movie featured prominently in the game's intro. This includes the appearances of a submerged Hollywood, the Dragon Mobile vehicle, Billy and Jimmy's ability to transform themselves and the inclusion of Koga Shuko as the game's final boss. However, the game's characters are depicted in a more anime-like style and only six of the game's twelve fighters are actually featured in the movie; Burnov and Duke are from previous Double Dragon games and rest were created specifically for this game. This game is dedicated to Kaneto Shiozawa, who died in 2000 and Daisuke Gori, who died in 2010.</desc>

		<desc>It has been two years since the second King Of Fighters tournament took place. Now Terry, Andy, Joe, Mai and Geese are back in South Town to battle five new characters and three bosses. All of them have their own reasons of coming to South Town, but in the end, everything links to a scroll that reveals the secret to the lost ancient martial arts.

Fatal Fury 3 was a pretty big improvement over its predecessors, introducing brand new re-drawn character sprites (yet again) and better overall animation quality. Of course, a handful of colorful new characters join the roster, in addition to some new 2D environments.

The two-plane gameplay was upgraded to a three plane format known as the Oversway System. Players fight primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or "oversway" into either of the sway lines at the background or foreground . Attacks between planes have returned but are now called "Oversway Attacks" and players can use special technique to defend these attacks. Other new gameplay elements introduced include air blocking, combination arts, new special &amp; super moves, and even alternate (more powerful) super moves which can only be used once per round.

Along with a cool looking world map, Fatal Fury 3 also features a ranking system when fighting against the computer, which brought some innovation to the fighting genre. When the player wins a round, they'll be ranked from D to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player's average... with a lower score, the game will end against Yamazaki, but with a higher score they will square off against one of the Jin twins, or possibly both. Overall,  Fatal Fury 3  was easily the best presentation of the series to date.</desc>

		<desc>Fights take place in stages ranging from train stations to boxing rings. Each character has a health bar that starts at full at the beginning of the fight. To win characters must inflict enough pain on their opponents to empty their health bars. In the event that the fight clock counts down to zero before one fighter is knocked out, the fighter with the most health remaining is declared the winner. Players must defeat each opponent twice in this fashion to be able to advance to the next round. Fight Fever does include one innovation, however inconsequential. After fights both the winner and the loser gets to say something.</desc>

		<name>Football Frenzy</name>
		<desc>Football Frenzy takes the modern game of football, and tosses out all aspects of the game which don't deal directly with running the ball, throwing the ball, or hitting the guy with the ball. There are no real world teams to contend with, and no real world stats that matter aside from the game's score and the game's time. There are also no substitutions.

Football Frenzy uses the Neo Geo's sprite scaling capabilities to provide either panned out or close in views depending on the action going on. The game is played from a top down perspective, but tilted to an angle so player profiles are more easily visible. Only a small portion of the field is visible at any time; to aid in orientation the game provides both a wireframe field with the current viewable portion indicated on the bottom of the screen, and a bar with sliding coloring indicating the current ball position on the field.</desc>

Musashi had an opportunity to see Kojiro's sword sometime before the duel and knew of its long length, so Musashi made his sword even longer. When Musashi arrived on the beach for the duel, he jumped over a low strike of Kojiro's, reaching about a meter off the ground and came down on Kojiro's head with his heavy wooden sword. Kojiro lay dying on the sand and Musashi left without killing him. Some of Musashi's critics called Musashi a coward for not killing Kojiro, but Musashi was satisfied that Kojiro had been defeated, but Kojiro comes back from the dead to try to kill Musashi.

The game's selectable characters are swordsman Ganryu and his female counterpart Suzume. The mission of the game is to rescue Ganryu's girlfriend from an evil ninja. Players are armed with a sword and a grappling claw.</desc>

The power of your shots is determined by how long you hold the button down for. That's about it really. There is a fair selection of International teams to choose from, each with their own different skills and with practice it is possible to score some impressive moves like bicycle kick! This can be good fun, however it can be too easy at times to score which means the game is easy to complete even on a higher difficulty setting.

		<desc>Gururin is a puzzle game with a twist, literally. Most puzzle games of this type involve trying to rearrange things that are falling out of the sky to try and get rid of them. Usually you do that by moving and rotating the pieces as they fall. So one day someone decided why not make a puzzle game where the board rotates instead of the pieces?

And Gururin is just that. The game drops odd-looking little people down from the top of the screen three at a time. Players must match characters in horizontal or vertical rows of three or more to make them disappear off the screen. To accomplish this players can rotate the board left or right before the pieces start their drop. Players can also move the pieces left or right during their descent to the bottom of the game board.</desc>

		<desc>Fighter's History was probably the most blatant rip-off of Street Fighter 2 in history (hence the title). Lo and behold, Data East had the audacity to make a sequel a year after the release of the original, even after Capcom tried to sue them for ripping off SF2.

Fighter's History Dynamite (also known as Karnov's Revenge) is at least an improvement over the original. The sequel adds playable bosses (Clown and Karnov) and two new characters: Zazie &amp; Yungmie. Besides a better selection of playable characters and some new backgrounds, the game itself really hasn't changed very much in terms of looks or gameplay.

While playing Karnov's Revenge, there's just no way to shake the feeling that this game is trying to be Street Fighter 2 with a different cast of characters. For the second time around, it doesn't offer any true innovation to the fighting game genre. Although, you could unlock a special fight against a bull if you beat the game without losing a single round, but who the hell would want to play this game for that long?</desc>

		<desc>King of the Monsters 2 is a 2D wrestling/fighting game with three monsters for players to select. Once the monster selection is completed players must guide their monsters through a series of stages consisting of parts of various famous world cities. Each level consists of a short side-scrolling portion in which the player's monster must deal with things like attacking tanks and ships. At the end of the side scrolling portion the alien boss monster appears for a fight.

The buildings and vehicles in the stages sometimes give up certain items when destroyed. The best type to collect is the power-up icon; up to two of these can be collected to boost the monster's strength. There are also icons that make monsters move faster or slower, drain collected power-up levels, explode for damage, or just provide points. Accumulated power-up levels carry over into subsequent stages.</desc>

The game is viewed from a side 2D view, and Joe can move up and down within the backgrounds as well as forwards and backwards. Fighting consists of using the four basic boxing punches, the straight, the hook, the body blow, and the uppercut, to take opponents down. During boxing matches each boxer has three health bars on screen, with the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second. When a boxer's health bar is drained he gets knocked down, but can get back up. When the third health bar is drained that boxer is knocked out and loses the match.</desc>

		<desc>In 2028, General Donald Morden launches an all-out, global attack against the Regular Army. With superior numbers and equipment, the Rebellion overwhelms the unsuspecting Regular Army troops easily. 

The attacks could have been countered effectively, or even prevented, should the high-ranking officials have listened to the Regular Army's intelligence community, which had been warning about all sorts of indications that the Rebellion could attack at any moment in decisive force. Unfortunately, the same officials decide to save their own skins and announce that it was the intelligence failure that led to such catastrophe, which the personnel serving in the intelligence community did not appreciate whatsoever. 

Meanwhile, Regular Army is pushed to near annihilation, with cities that it was suppose to be protecting in ruins. General Morden makes an announcement that all of the major cities around the world will be under his control within 170 hours, also adding that any resistance would be futile. 

The announcement certainly did not discourage a band of Regular Army soldiers attempt to salvage whatever they had left. Shortly after, a group named "Resistants" are formed by surviving members of the Regular Army and its researchers, who began to covertly convert the Metal Slug tank prototypes into combat-ready status in a hidden factory, hoping to launch a counter-offensive to regain what they had lost to the Rebellion. Morden just as quickly learns of this fact and attacks the plant, crushing the Resistants and capturing the tanks, putting an end to the counterattack even before it could begin. The vehicles are then scattered to prevent any ragtag Regular Army troops reclaiming them and using them to launch attacks. 

Seeing the Regular Army panic and crumble, 1st Lieutenant Marco Rossi of the Regular Army Peregrine Falcons special forces unit quickly unites remaining Regular Army units and begins a commando operation to reclaim the tanks. Fighting alongside him is Second Lieutenant Tarma Roving from the same unit. Their main objectives were to engage the Rebellion and neutralize its leader, General Morden, while reclaiming the Metal Slug tanks to aid them in battles. If the tanks could not be recaptured, then they would have to destroy them to prevent them from being used by the Rebellion. 

The player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and "Metal Slug" tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense.
The protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.

During the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.
There are a total of six levels, with themes ranging from forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases.</desc>

Instrumental in squashing Morden's rebel forces, Marco and Tarma of the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force are ordered to lead the team after their earlier requests for resignation were denied. Although General Morden has been written off as "missing" by his followers, they have hidden themselves throughout the world, and Marco and Tarma's abilities and experience are seen as a necessity to destroy remaining rebel strongholds, one by one. Throughout the furious fighting against the holdouts, Marco and Tarma cannot help but suspect Morden's involvement in this new evil plan for world domination.</desc>

This pattern continues up to 500 yen coins; two five-hundred yen coins placed next to each other will disappear, helping to clear the player's side and pushing down the coins on the opponent's side. If at any time coins touch the bottom of the screen, the player loses.</desc>

		<desc>Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory is a soccer video game based on the FIFA World Cup 1998, despite being released after the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It features 73 teams countries. Each team enters a "Regional Qualifying Round Final" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player wins the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For Example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, Kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (Teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). It's slogan is "We got the kick".

Unlike its arcade counter-part, the Neo Geo version tries to be more of a soccer simulation game. Differences include the Neo Geo version more slowed down, and more realism added in shooting, passing, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Neo Mr. Do! is the Neo Geo adaptation of the 1982 arcade game Mr. Do!. Mr. Do is a clown, and he wants to harvest his orchard. He can beat a level by either collecting all the cherries in the level or by killing all the bad guys. Additionally, if Mr. Do can step on a trigger to cause the bad guys spelling EXTRA to appear, and then kills them all, he can progress to a timed bonus stage.

The game has a lot in common with the classic game Dig Dug. Mr. Do must tunnel through his orchard to get to the cherries, but as he creates tunnels he creates more avenues for the bad guys to travel through. There are small and large orange circular faces scattered throughout the boards. By tunneling under them and removing their supports Mr. Do can cause them to fall and break, exposing power-up items that can enhance Mr. Do in a variety of ways. If a falling orange block catches an enemy it's destroyed. But then again so is Mr. Do.</desc>

		<desc>Nightmare in the Dark is a platform game released in 2000 by SNK in arcades and never released for home consoles. It concerns the story of a gravedigger discovering a few graves being desecrated, and his attempt to prevent the graverobbers from inflicting further damage.

There lived one gravedigger at a very small village in a remote region. He lived a quiet, solitary life in a corner of the cemetery. He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance. One day, he found the graves were ransacked and some corpses were stolen. He didn't want the village people to find out, so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself. Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.

A good ghoul goes around graveyards protecting them from evil doers. The player clears the area and collecting power ups using it to eliminate the enemies. There are five stages with five levels each, and each one of them has you throwing fireballs at ghouls, ghosts, goblins, and zombies. When you keep throwing fireballs at these enemies, they will ignite into a giant fireball, which you can throw at other enemies to kill them, and get the remaining treasure before moving on to the next level. At the end of the fifth level, a boss must be defeated in order to continue the game.</desc>

An elite group of three young Ninja Commandos (Joe Tiger, an American descendant of the Koga-ryu ninja whose weapons are shuriken, Ryu Eagle, the 23rd descendant of the famous ninja Fuma Kotaro (from World Heroes), who is using ninja magic fireballs in combat, and Rayar Dragon, the female ninja of the group, a British girl who has learned the ways of the Iga-ryu ninjutsu and whose weapon is a bow with flaming spirit arrows) from around the world must team-up to stop the villain Spider and his Mars Corporation from using a time machine to destroy the past and control the future. The three heroes chase after their enemy in seven time periods, including the Sengoku period in Japan (where Ryu avenges his ancestor by killing Oda Nobunaga), Ancient Egypt, the Stone Age, China in the era of Three Kingdoms, and World War II.[</desc>

As expected for the genre, the game pits your selected character against a series of opponents in best-of-3 round matches, with your objective being to deplete your opponents health bar with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific control motions) and super moves (which rely on a power gauge). All the characters in Ninja Master's fight with their weapon of choice, but you can freely choose to put your weapon away and go mano a mano. This does not have a major impact on speed or attack power, but changes the movesets significantly changing the way even basic attacks work.

Uses 2D sprite-based graphics and features 1P or 2P Vs gameplay.</desc>

Each vehicle has its own handling characteristics and performs differently on various terrain types. 

A large screen showing a simplified overhead map of the current course section takes up part of the top left section of the screen. The map shows players their current location as well as the course ahead, giving them a chance to react to turns before they see them. Just before a turn, the game also provides more help in the form of blinking arrows indicating the direction that the course is heading.</desc>

		<desc>The king of certain country wants to find a worthy successor for the throne and the ideal husband for his little daughter (or a beautiful and strong woman for his older son). So he holds a fighting tournament where the prize is the hand of the princess and the throne succession.

Power Instinct: Matrimelee is a sequel to the obscure and lesser known Power Instinct series. The characters of Matrimelee range from incredibly strange (including two hobbit-granny sprite clones &amp; a furry) to the I've-seen-you-somewhere-before stereotypes (complete with a cut &amp; paste ninja, a generic native American, and your basic karate guy). Several characters from Rage of The Dragons also make a cross-over to the game.

In  Matrimelee, the staple super combo gauge is replaced with the "Stress Gauge". Unlike most combo gauges, the Street Gauge doesn't fill when players connect with attacks. Instead it fills when attacks are blocked and when damage is taken. This is to simulate the "stress" of not having your moves land, and/or the stress one may feel when punched in the face.  When the Stress Gauge fills up, a super combo can be performed. Characters also become invulnerable to attacks and will also interrupt combos.

In some stages, a referee will be standing in the background. Players can actually call him into the foreground and use him to attack their enemies... either sending the ref flying into the opponent, or using him as a human shield for opponent's projectiles.  A "Bloodline Battle" can also be initiated if two players taunt one after the other. When a Bloodline Battle begins, both characters move to the middle of the screen. Between them lowers a television screen which randomly shows different buttons (A,B,C,D). Which ever player hits the buttons first, their character will gain a free attack on the opponent.</desc>

The game retains the three-plane "oversway" system from Fatal Fury 3, which features a main lane for fighting, with foreground and background planes used to avoid attacks or leap towards the opponent. A dedicated button is now used to make an "oversway" (or change plane) towards the background or foreground.

Real Bout introduces a Power Gauge, which fills up as the player performs normal or special techniques against their opponent or defend themselves, similar to many super move gauges featured in other fighting games. The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge.

Real Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previously introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.</desc>

However, the extra versions of Tung, Mary, Andy, and Billy are gone. Two new characters are introduced: Li Xiangfei, a Chinese American waitress; and Rick Strowd, a Native American boxer.

You control one of two robots who use its fists and special attacks to take on the army throughout a jungle stage and various buildings in the destroyed city. Robots and robot dogs sometimes leave arms or metal bars that can be used as weapons. At the end of each area, you need to defeat a boss in order to proceed to the next area.</desc>

		<desc>The game is set in the late 18th century and all the characters wield weapons. The game uses comparatively authentic music from the time period, rife with sounds of traditional Japanese instruments, such as the shakuhachi and shamisen, and a refined version of the camera zoom first found in Art of Fighting. True to its use of bladed weapons, the game also included copious amounts of blood.</desc>

		<name>Samurai Shodown III</name>
		<desc>Samurai Shodown III was to be the start of a bold new direction for the franchise.

The most obvious difference between this game and the others in the series is the notably darker aesthetic. The more light-hearted characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an to name a few) from the previous games have been excised, and even the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.</desc>

In spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively).</desc>

		<name>Samurai Shodown V</name>
		<desc>Samurai Shodown has been a long-respected 2D fighting series for its animated and colorful characters offset by subtly gritty and intense swordplay. In terms of weapons-based fighters, there’s no comparing this game with the brilliant 3D visuals and the fluid offensive-and-defensive gameplay of last year’s Soul Caliber III, they are of different decades. The original Samurai Shodown came to market the same year as the first Mortal Kombat, and though it offered no “finishing moves”, the screen was frequently painted red with the arterial spray of blood from the losing character. 

In this fifth iteration of Samurai Shodown, however, some of that intensity, and blood, isn’t as prevalent. There are a total of 26 characters to choose from, and the series best are represented --  Haohmaru, Hanzo, Jubei, Genjuro, Nakaruru (and her bird). Of course, it wouldn’t be an SNK title if there weren’t some truly bizarre characters as well. Kusaregedo, an oversized mutant with a purple vomit attack, would be a more appropriate character for Ghost Hunter. And true-to-form, the story mode ultimately pits you against “Gaoh” an overlord who has (wait for it...) demon-transformation powers.</desc>

This does not sit well with the rest of the Fuun-Ken fighters around the world, so they all decide to beat each other up in classic 2 round fights to decide who gets to get down with King Lion himself.

Savage Reign is a one-on-one 2D fighter in which you select your character and try to defeat all challengers using your basic attacks and special moves. The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.</desc>

The game incorporates a more complex fighting system similar to a one-on-one fighting game, by giving players different attack buttons, special moves based on directional inputs, combos and even a super bar used to unleash devastating super moves. You cannot change weapons or transform into other characters as in the previous games, but you can acquire different ranged weapons for additional attacks as well as unlock certain bosses to increase your available characters.</desc>

The object of the game is to go toward the end of the level and defeat the end-of-level boss, which is usually a huge vehicle. Crates that are scattered throughout the levels can be broken into to reveal new weapons and power-ups.

There is a team mode where players have to select three characters. The characters can be switched on-the-fly during gameplay, which is useful if one of them is badly injured. Players can use the other teammates until life-ups can be found.</desc>

		<name>SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is based on the KOF series (particularly The King of Fighters 2002), with the same four button configuration and many of the same techniques. However, the game does not use the Team Battle format, but follows the traditional round-based one-on-one format. Each match begins with a dialogue exchange between the player's character and the opponent. One new technique introduced in the game is the Front Grand Step, which allows the player to leap towards the opponent and cancel into a basic attack. The player can perform this technique while guarding from an opponent's attack, which will consume one Power Gauge level.
The game uses a different type of Power Gauge known as the Groove Power Gauge System, which has three levels. The Groove gauge fills as the player lands attacks against the opponents or guard attacks. When the gauge fills to Lv. 1 or Lv. 2, the player can perform Super Special Moves, a Guard Cancel Attack or a Guard Cancel Front Step maneuver. When the gauge is full, its reaches MAXIMUM level and a MAX Activation occurs. During MAX Activation, the gauge will change into a timer and the player gains the ability to cancel any of their moves anytime (in addition to Super Special Moves and Guard Cancels). Once the timer runs out, the gauge returns to Lv. 2.
In addition to the regular Super Special Move, each character also has an Exceed move which can only be performed once when the player's life is less than half.</desc>

		<desc>Many years ago, a large treasure was hidden by a mysterious guy on an uncharted island. The guy of mystery drew the location of the treasure on a map and hid it deep in the forest of the island. Days turned to weeks, weeks turned to years, and years turned to decades. The guy who hid the map disappeared, never to be seen again. During this time, the map became dirty and weathered, eventually tearing into five pieces which were scattered about the corners of the world. One of these pieces wafted its way into the possession of the young treasure seeker name Johnny. Living with his girlfriend Mary and his rugged sidekick name Tom, Johnny dreamed of the day when he would some day find the ancient treasure on the hidden island of the mysterious guy.

Then one day, the greedy, treasure-seeking mad scientist, Dr. De Playne appeared in Johnny's little town. Seizing Johnny's piece of the treasure map and kidnapping Mary, Dr. De Playne set out to find the treasure and buy up all the toys and candy of the world, plunging the children of earth into a bitter darkness of continuous study and well-balanced meals. Johnny and Tom pursued the mad Dr. De Playne with their yo-yos to save Mary and the world.</desc>

Choosing from one of the game's selection of horses, players must compete in a series of races on different tracks to earn money and prestige. Each horse that players can select is rated according to speed, stamina, and burst.

Players control their horses with the joystick and three buttons. Pressing the A button repeatedly keeps the horse accelerated with a slight drain of the stamina bar, while pressing the B button applies the rider crop to the horse. This results in a slight burst of speed at the cost of draining the horse's stamina bar faster.</desc>

They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.</desc>

		<name>The Irritating Maze</name>
		<desc>The Irritating Maze quite literally lives up to its name. It's a maze, of sorts, and it's one hell of an irritating game. In fact, it is one of the most irritating games that most will ever come across. But it does have its charms, namely its offbeat gameplay.

The graphics are bright and colorful, with a lot of eye candy everywhere. Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing, as all that coloring and eye candy has been designed specifically to distract you from beating the level. All that glitter is isolated to the areas immediately surrounding the track, and if you look off the beaten path you'll notice that the graphics there are quite sparse and simplistic.

The sound and music are passable, though not particularly good. The Irritating Maze's songs sound like generic puzzle game music and are generally pretty forgettable, but they do fit the game's mood. You'll hear an announcer's voice at certain points of the game telling you that you've passed a checkpoint or something like that. 

The announcer sounds reasonably excited, though if you listen you can hear a little bit of electronic fuzz distorting the voice clips. One sound clip stands out above the rest though, and that's the electric zap effect that plays when you lose. When this clip is combined with the associated graphics, the effect is literally shocking.

One of the biggest reasons why the game is so irritating is that you have to control your character's conducting rod with a trackball. For most people, the trackball is not an ideal input device for precise control, especially when put under the stress of time limits. A digital joystick or D-pad would actually allow you to have more precise control, but then having to deal with unfamiliar controls is part of the "fun." 

At first you'll find the innovative gameplay to be a lot of fun, much like Marble Madness. But unlike Marble Madness, The Irritating Maze's gameplay gets old relatively quickly, and you'll find yourself not caring enough to give the level another go. The Irritating Maze is different enough to be entertaining for a couple of minutes but not quite polished enough to be a lot of fun for the long haul. Give it a quarter or two and see how you do.</desc>

Having become bored with the lack of competition, Rugal decides to host a new King of Fighters tournament. Rugal has his secretary travel to eight destinations around the world and invite fighters to his new tournament. Unlike the previous KOF tournaments depicted in the Fatal Fury series, the new King of Fighters is a team tournament, with eight teams of three, each representing a different nationality, participating this time. Most characters come from other SNK games, such as Team Italy, which is composed of three heroes from the original Fatal Fury: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi. The two heroes from Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia) are featured along with their mentor and Ryo's father (Takuma Sakazaki) make up Team Mexico. Team Korea features Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury 2 as the leader of two convicts he's trying to reform Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, while Team England is a mix of female fighters from Fatal Fury 2 (Mai Shiranui) and the Art of Fighting series (Yuri Sakazaki, King). The two heroes from Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou) form Team China along with their mentor, Chin Gentsai. Similarly, Team Brazil features the heroes from Ikari Warriors (Ralf and Clark) along with their commanding officer Heidern. Additionally, the game features two teams composed entirely of original characters: Team Japan featuring Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon, and Team USA composed of Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler.</desc>

		<desc>The King of Fighters '95 marks the beginning of a story arc that later became known as the "Orochi Saga". However, the only elements from the Orochi Saga known in this game is the introduction of Kyo's rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal's use of the Orochi power

Rugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game, had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous game signed simply 'R'. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament: the American Sports Team, now replaced by the "Rival Team" consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from Fatal Fury: King of Fighters), and Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2). Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo's father, appears as a fighter for the first time (having made a non-playable cameo in KOF '94) as a computer-controlled sub-boss character. After defeating Saisyu in the arcade mode, it is revealed that Saisyu was being brainwashed and that Rugal will fight once again as a boss character, but as an enhanced version named "Omega Rugal".</desc>

		<desc>A new King of Fighters tournament was announced, though the letters of invitation sent out to the fighters were no longer sent by Rugal Bernstein. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament's approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments since the previous year, the King of Fighters tournament's fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds from around the world. The tournament is now held by Chizuru Kagura: a descendant of the ancient Yata Clan responsible for sealing the Orochi demon along with the Kusanagi and Yasanaki clan (the clans from Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, respectively). Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren't exactly willing to work together on friendly terms.</desc>

Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss.</desc>

		<desc>The tenth installment in SNK's long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...

This year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).</desc>

		<desc>The Last Blade (幕末浪漫 月華の剣士 Bakumatsu Roman: Gekka no Kenshi?, "Romance of the Bakumatsu: The Swordsman of Moonlight"), is a fighting game series created by SNK for the Neo Geo system. The Korean version of the game is known as "The Last Soldier". The Last Blade and its sequel are widely considered to be two of the most accomplished games available for the Neo Geo system,[1][2] with fan opinion divided as to which is the better installment.

The game takes place during the late Tokugawa shogunate era in Japan, and incorporates various elements of Japanese mythology (with a heavy emphasis on the symbology of the Four Symbols). As such, the background music generally incorporates synthesized instruments simulating a sound appropriate to the 19th century setting, in a Western classical, pseudo-Romantic style (unusual for a fighting game).</desc>

You can scroll left and right through hallways and enter any doors you come across by pressing forward. You can also walk forward into any vertical hallways you encounter to get to horizontal hallways further in the background. The game consists of a series of levels, all laid out as mazes with horizontal and vertical hallways to traverse.</desc>

In the World Championship, each location consists of different stages that need to be finished in a single run. There is a strict time limit and you receive a time bonus upon finishing a section. The Dakar mode is one long track without stops. The championship uses regular cars, but in the Dakar race you can also choose a sand buggy, off-road bike or a truck.</desc>

The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special "boss" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.</desc>

Each character has a super meter that can be increased rapidly by successfully attacking opponents, but will also steadily increase even if the character isn't doing anything. Once filled up to level one the meter can be used in one of several ways. The characters each have several unique special moves activated with a joystick motion and one punch or kick button. By pressing both punch or kick buttons instead of just one players can unleash an enhanced version of the special attack that does more damage, but also uses up one level of the super meter. Players can also use two different types of desperation moves, both of which drain one level of the meter. The first type does moderate damage, but is executed reasonably fast. The second type does enormous damage, but has a charge time of several seconds during which they can be hit out of the desperation.</desc>

Instead, players will face off against groups of three characters at a time. Players will fight each character for one round, with the requirement for advancing being to win two of the three rounds. After fighting five sets of three characters, players then face a series of characters in single combat until the ending fight with Zeus.</desc>
