		<name>1941: Counter Attack (World 900227) </name>
		<desc>1941 Counter Attack is a vertical shooter by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990. The action takes place during World War II and depicts Capcom's own fantastic vision of the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player's mission is rather straightforward - on board a Lockheed P-38 airplane, he must fight his way through six varied stages, take down enemy installations, battleships and other huge rockets on their narrow launching pads. Unlike its predecessors in the series, 1941 Counter Attack traded the trademark and arguably monotonous level design for a more structured and diverse formula. Stages vary from an enemy infested canyon to city landscapes and fortified strongholds. Several powerups can be collected along the way, such as tiny wingmen widening the plane's fire power, or destructive special weapons such as laser beams and side rockets. The main weapon can also be charged up by holding the fire button to discharge a powerful attack. Finally, the plane comes with a small life bar and can be hit three time before being blasted into oblivion - this bar however increases as the game progresses, and is used to release devastating special attacks as well. 1941 Counter Attack also features a two simultaneous player mode.

		<name>1943 Kai: Midway Kaisen (Japan) </name>
		<desc>1943 Kai is a vertical shooter and conversion of Capcom's popular arcade game originally released in 1987. This version was however developed by Naxat Soft and this port is essentially an enhanced remake of the original game. The action takes place during World War II and depicts the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player flies a Stearman biplane fighter plane and must destroy endless waves of enemy fighter planes, bombers and large battleships. The Stearman is equipped with a standard machine-gun that can be upgraded in all kind of ways. Formation of red enemy places drop special icons when defeated, and shooting at the same icons again loops through various power-ups and items, such as POW options (extra health), Shot Gun, 3-Ways, Super Shells, Lasers, Side Fighters or various special items such as the Double Pill (energy boost). The trademark Capcom special items are also scattered throughout the game, such as the Cow, the strawberry or the Yashichi (red and white twister/wheel shaped item) which gives the player an instant refill of energy. The second button is also used to release super-bombs that clean up the screen in exchange of some of the plane's energy, or make it loop in the air and avoid harmful enemy bullets. 1943-Kai features all the stages from the arcade game, as well as an original mode and a two player option.

		<name>1943: Midway Kaisen (Japan, Rev B) </name>
		<desc>1943 is a vertical shooter by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1987 (and sequel of 1942). The game takes place during World War II and is set in the Pacific air war theater. The player takes control of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning American war plane and fights his way through twenty four stages over the Midway Atoll, and the main goal of the game is to annihilate the Japanese air fleet and sea forces. The P-38 comes equipped with several forms of defense - a primary Vulcan Gun that can be charged up by holding the fire button, and a special power attack that can be unleashed in a blinding flash of lightning. However, the latter use some of the plane's own power - fuel is at the core of the gameplay and it depletes as the game progresses, or when the player takes damage. Power-ups are usually obtained by taking down formations of red planes, and they range from Pow icons (restores energy), shotgun (upgrades the main weapon to a weak spread gun) and double-cell (refills more energy). However, more weapons (such as a second spread gun, lasers, missiles and so forth) can be unlocked as the game progresses. Unlike its predecessor, 1943 gives the player the ability to customize the P-38 before battle and throughout the game - offensive power, defensive power, energy level, special weapons and special weapons time limit are all attributes that can be modified and improved. Moreover, special power-ups are hidden throughout the game, and although most of them give players extra energy or points, a special flower shaped power-up icon gives players the opportunity to further improve the plane's stats (a rare dragonfly icon also offers twice the number of power-up points). Finally the game features a password system allowing players to save their progress.

Description from the USA back cover:
Conventional baseball no longer exists in the year 2020. The Super Baseball Association has been very profitable over the years with robotics power players up against the strongest of athletes. Due to the secret manipulation of certain robotics team players, abilities have been computer controlled to decide the outcome of certain games, benefiting the SBA. Die hard players discovered the SBA's cheating and have now disconnected several parts of the computers to achieve fair and challenging play. Now the games may continue in the famed Cyber-Egg Stadium where only power and skill will determine the winner!

		<name>600 </name>
		<desc>600 is your standard maze game (one of dozens released in the wake of "Pac-Man", with a few twists. The game begins by showing your turtle entering a building (a very early 'cut scene'), you are then presented with the first maze. Each maze has several boxes (with question marks on them), scattered around. You must open these boxes one at a time by walking on to them. Each box contains either an enemy race car (who will pursue you), or a 'KidTurtle'. The 'KidTurtles' are what you are looking for here. When you find one it will climb onto your back, and you have to take it back to the turtle house which will be located in one of the corners. After you rescue a few turtles the game becomes more difficult because of the amount of baddies that you will have released. However, you have some energy you can use to lay land mines. You can drop these in the path of a baddie, and cause him to freeze temporarily (you can safely walk over frozen baddies). A new game screen starts after you rescue all the 'KidTurtles'. After 8 levels you get to watch a small ending sequence, and then the game starts over with increased difficulty.

		<desc>Strap yourself into the cockpit and squeeze off heat-seeking missiles in this grittily realistic jet-fighter shooter. 

Sinister forces have melted the Antarctic ice cap, flooding the earth's cities. No one knows where they came from or what they want. But when the mysterious invaders attack Tokyo, you're called to lead an elite international team of pilots into the incredibly wild blue yonder!

In single-player mode, AeroFighters Assault features eight primary and four bonus missions. The game features four aircraft, plus two bonus fighters. Your enemies come at you in jet fighters, helicopters, submarines and frigates, guaranteeing endless wing time as you blow away aliens bent on world conquest. There are giant bosses, too! 

The action takes place over cities, oceans dotted with icebergs and parched desert. For pure flying fun, Multiplayer mode features a sky stage in which you run absolutely no risk of running into the ground. AeroFighters Assault supports full 360-degree action by allowing you to switch among multiple camera views at any time. 

The product of an unprecedented partnership between arcade specialist Video System and the flight sim masters at Paradigm Entertainment, AeroFighters expands on the traditional shooter by adding plenty of authentic touches. The Paradigm team logged plenty of wing time crafting high-tech flight sims for military pilots before helping Shigeru Miyamoto and his NCL team develop Pilotwings 64. With experience like that, AeroFighters is a first-rate flight sim, complete with a stunning flight-physics model and dazzling acrobatic moves.

A savvy veteran of the arcade wars, Video Systems made sure to pack AeroFighters Assault with white-knuckle action, especially when you're dogfighting a buddy in two-player mode.

Redrawing the intricately detailed fighters at supersonic speeds would tax most game systems, but the powerful N64 never misses a beat. The Controller's analog Control Stick gives you pin-point control as you bank, roll and plunge into screaming dives after your high-powered enemies.

		<desc>The player has been issued an emergency order. He must save the earth from being conquered by enemy forces. He climbs into his helicopter and prepares for intense aerial combat. Shooting oncoming enemy aircrafts and bombing the enemies below, he tries to make his way through the different stages to reach the enemy base. When he finishes the first stage, he is transported to his next mission by ab aircraft carrier. He hops into his jet fighters, tanks, ships, helicopters, and aircraft carriers. The player must also be aware of unseen enemies and surprise attacks.

Different kinds of power ups can be obtained throughout the game. These include:
'3' 3-Way: Bullets fire forward, right, and left.
'L' Laser: Player can shoot double lasers.
'T' Triple: Missiles are fired that spread out three ways in front.
'V' Vulcan: Rapid bullets are fired in the directions controlled.
'B' Bomb: Air to ground missles which can be upgraded twice.
'O' Orbital: A small drone using the same weaponry as the helicopter which can be otained by clearing a special formation of little red fighters.

There is an additional super weapon that destroys all the enemies on the screen at once. However, use of this weapon is limited.

Ajax contains 2 different types of stages : 2-D and 3-D. In the 2-D stage, the player controls a helicopter. In the 3-D stage, the player commands a jet fighter.

Ajax features some impressive graphics filled with rotation and scaling effects (some may get a little dizzy, though!), a solid soundtrack and excellent game control. Highly recommended for any shoot'em up enthusiast!

		<name>Ajax (Japan) </name>
		<desc>The player has been issued an emergency order. He must save the earth from being conquered by enemy forces. He climbs into his helicopter and prepares for intense aerial combat. Shooting oncoming enemy aircrafts and bombing the enemies below, he tries to make his way through the different stages to reach the enemy base. When he finishes the first stage, he is transported to his next mission by ab aircraft carrier. He hops into his jet fighters, tanks, ships, helicopters, and aircraft carriers. The player must also be aware of unseen enemies and surprise attacks.

Different kinds of power ups can be obtained throughout the game. These include:
'3' 3-Way: Bullets fire forward, right, and left.
'L' Laser: Player can shoot double lasers.
'T' Triple: Missiles are fired that spread out three ways in front.
'V' Vulcan: Rapid bullets are fired in the directions controlled.
'B' Bomb: Air to ground missles which can be upgraded twice.
'O' Orbital: A small drone using the same weaponry as the helicopter which can be otained by clearing a special formation of little red fighters.

There is an additional super weapon that destroys all the enemies on the screen at once. However, use of this weapon is limited.

Ajax contains 2 different types of stages : 2-D and 3-D. In the 2-D stage, the player controls a helicopter. In the 3-D stage, the player commands a jet fighter.

Ajax features some impressive graphics filled with rotation and scaling effects (some may get a little dizzy, though!), a solid soundtrack and excellent game control. Highly recommended for any shoot'em up enthusiast!

Game description from the Tengen manual:
The year is 2089 of the Galactic Calendar. In this far-flung future, humans have colonized the outer planets. Without warning, the glory of this achievement turned into disaster: A horrible race of aliens has imprisoned an entire colony aboard its space ships! Each of these vessels houses countless numbers of slimy monsters led by a vicious alien boss. Having miraculously escaped capture, you must go from ship to ship in a valiant effort to save your fellow humans.

		<name>Area 88 (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Area 88 is a side scrolling shooter by Capcom, conversion of their own arcade game originally. An evil general and his army are taking over the world and they must be stopped. A group of three highly skilled mercenary pilots who blow things up for cash, Shin Kazama, Mickey Scymon and Greg Gates, accept the mission readily. On board of their aircrafts they're now ready to defeat the greedy dictator and restore peace. One of the distinctive feature of the game is the ability given to the player to purchase new weapons and fighter planes. Right from the start, pilots are offered a F8E Crusader fighter and some cash. Then after each mission, the earned cash can be used to purchase new weapons or a brand new fighter giving the player a sense of customization. But there is a catch and special weapons and cash are lost if the player happens to die during a mission. Each pilot also comes with his own specialty - Shin, the young hero pilot, can level up the standard plane's Vulcan gun faster than his friends, Mickey, the hot-shot, can carry more special weapons and Greg, the veteran, has more health and can recover faster from injuries. The game is vast and offers not less than ten intense stages. It is however one player only.

		<desc>The story (from the USA Manual):

Their earth-like planet was devastated by a brutal attack of aliens. The survivors roam the galaxy on their photon spaceship Arkanoid in search of a new home. The Arkanoid is attacked and the survivors barely escape in the Vaus spacecraft. Instead of finding safety, they are now trapped in a deadly space labyrinth.

If they are to be saved, you must summon all your courage and skill to shatter the space walls and defeat the merciless enemy forces!

		<desc>In Arm Wrestling, the player takes on a number of different, distinctly cartoon-like opponents in a series of arm wrestling matches. The game's graphical styling is very similar to Nintendo's classic "Punch-Out!!" series. Gameplay requires that the player initially pushes the joystick to the left, but whenever the computer opponent starts to act, the player must push the joystick to the right to counter-attack, and press the button to increase power. If the counterattack is unsuccessful, moving the joystick back and forth several times will prevent the player from being pinned. The player's opponent must be pinned before the counter reaches one minute, or the match will be lost.

		<name>Armed Formation </name>
		<desc>Armed Formation F is a vertical shooter by Big Don and the adaptation of Nichibutsu's arcade game originally released in 1988. The player takes control of a red spacecraft called the Vowger and fights his way through several stages made up of all kind of organic components. Tentaculous eye-balls and all sort of armed shellfish try to stop the player in his progression. To help the Vowger fulfill its mission, special power-ups can be retrieved from flying pods scattered around the game. They deliver basic upgrades such as speed-ups and, more interestingly, new weaponry. The list is actually quite large and includes side-bombs, laser-beams, homing-missiles and other colorful and flashy disc-beams. These power-ups vary throughout the game and each stage features its own set of weapons. Special flying orbs can be collected and have the ability to stay close to the ship to protect it. The second attack button can send them fly in formation for a short amount of time (hence the title of the game).

Improve your chance of survival by playing with an ally.  But beware of the deadly helicopter flying overhead... no place is safe frm this treacherous enemy.

You can select any of three game play options. They are:

GAME 1: The buildings are drawn in on the screen giving you a clear picture of the obstacles.  The joystick is used to rotate your jeep, but buttons 1 and 2 can also be used to fine tune your movements. Every time you press button 1 or 2 you rotate only SLIGHTLY to the left or right.

GAME 2: The buildings are drawn in on the screen, as in GAME 1. The joystick can be used to rotate your jeep, but buttons 1 and 2 can also be used to rotate your jeep freely to the left or right. There is no fine tuning feature in this option.

GAME 3: The buildings are not drawn in on the screen, creating a blind maze. The joystick or buttons 1 and 2 can be used to rotate your jeep, as in GAME 2.

This game uses a unique control method and uses 'Mode 7' background scaling and rotation effects like those found in Super Nintendo/Super Famicom games. The most interesting feature is firing 'catapult' bomb shots far away with the left joystick pushed to the left side and the right joystick to the right at the same time, while pressing the fire trigger.

An upgrade of this game is called "Assault Plus".

Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Namco Video Game Graffiti Volume 3 - VDR-5278) on December 16, 1988.

		<name>Asteroids (rev 4) </name>
		<desc>Asteroids is a legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre-defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a spaceship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins. 

Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds. 

As well as the ever-present asteroids, flying saucers also make a regular appearance. These move horizontally and diagonally around the screen, firing at the player's ship, and must be quickly destroyed. They are destroyed when hit by the player's shot, when hit by a saucer's shot or when they collide with an asteroid. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger. 

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart into two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat. 

Small Saucer - The smaller flying saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.

		<desc>...It seems as though you've been here before - but this time, it's much worse! The Asteroids are faster, the enemy ships are much more skilled marksmen than your first time through this galaxy...and what's this odd hexagon-shaped craft I keep hearing about? Asteroids plunge at you! Trapped in a gigantic cloud of asteroids, your struggling spaceship hurls towards its doom. You'll have to pulverize all the asteroids with your photon cannon to save your ship and your life! 

Rubble from an exploding asteroid bounces off your ship's hull. A glowing blur flashes across your viewing screen. So that's where the rubble came from! The asteroid was blasted by an Alien Robot Saucer! Alien Robot Saucers are also trapped in the asteroid cloud. And they fire at you! You know that the metal in your ship's hull will register on their target finders before the asteroids do. The saucers could be a worse danger than the asteroids! More rubble strikes your ship. Its hull rings like a bell. If you don't get busy, that could be your death knell!

		<name>Astro Blaster (version 1) </name>
		<desc>Astro Blaster is a 1- or 2-player game in which players must advance through squadrons of alien ships in an attempt to dock with the mother ship. Players move their ship left or right and shoot at attacking squadrons. A special time warp allows the player to slow down the alien space ships and their laser fire, while maintaining his own ship and laser fire at normal speed.

As players go through the game play, each step is directed by the voice of mission control. Mission control keeps players informed of fuel status, provides a countdown on warp, keeps track of the number of ships remaining, and monitors the player's laser temperature.

As players enter each new sector they encounter a different number of alien squadrons. Players must destroy all ships in each squadron to pass through the sector. One squadron of rockets is extremely difficult to destroy, but players can pass through this squadron by hitting a few enemy ships. Once a player has destroyed all the squadrons in that sector, he enters an asteroid belt. He must maneuver and shoot his way through the asteroids to reach the mother ship. If fuel is critically low when the player enters the asteroid belt, he can receive extra fuel by shooting the red fireballs interspersed among the asteroids. After passing through the asteroid belt, the player's ship docks with the mother ship and refuels.

There are 29 different alien squadrons players encounter as they move through the different sectors. Every new sector increases in difficulty with different numbers of squadrons in each sector. Each alien ship has its own individualized sounds, movements and firing capability.

During their game, players must keep track of fuel consumption. As the player's ship moves through the sector, it consumes fuel. The player must ensure he has enough fuel to advance through the sector and dock with the mother ship. Extra fuel can only be obtained by shooting red fireballs or docking with the mother ship. The screen also displays the laser temperature. As players fire, the laser temperature rises. When they cease firing it cools down. If the laser overheats, players lose their laser fire until it cools down.

By depressing the warp button, players slow down the enemy ships and their laser fire while maintaining his own at normal speed. Players receive one warp per ships and are awarded one warp upon docking, if he has used his warp in the previous sector.

Each alien ship destroyed carries a different point value. Players also receive double points for destroying an alien ship when their fuel is in the red. To add further excitement, there are 25 tasks that a player performs during the course of the game and receives a secret bonus. Players do not know what these tasks are, but a good player will keep track. The 25 tasks are consistent throughout the game. Players also receive a bonus for any fuel they have left when they dock with the mother ship.

With a two-player game, players alternate at the conclusion of each sector, not after each ship.  Players receive 3 to 5 ships, which is operator adjustable. The game is over when a player runs out of fuel, loses all his ships, or crashes while attempting to dock with the mother ship. The top three scores are displayed and the game ranks players from 1 to 99.

PLAY INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Shoot enemy space ships for points.
2. Shoot fire balls for extra fuel.
3. Use warp to slow down enemy ships and bombs (only once per sector or ship).
4. Discover how to earn secret bonuses for extra points.
5. Dock with mother ship to refuel after each sector.
6. Game over when you run out of ships or fuel.
7. Laser will not fire while overheated.

		<desc>Avalanche is a 2-D game of skill. You control a multi-storied platform with a spinner-knob. Your goal is to prevent the falling rocks from ever reaching the ground. There are six rows of rocks to deal with. You start with a 6-storied platform and you lose one platform per row of rocks cleared. You score points for those rocks you prevent from reaching the ground. Of course, the farther the row of rocks, the smaller and faster they become. Your ultimate goal is to get enough points so that you can continue your game should you lose your first one. Get your hard hat out and prepare to catch some rogue rocks.

		<desc>The actual game has you piloting a little space tank. The tank and its turret are controlled independently, which allows you to move in one direction while shooting in another. Your mission is to guard various space outposts from hordes of incoming enemy ships. Each level will have several outposts all clustered together in the center. If an enemy ship touches an outpost, then the outpost is destroyed. You can activate a long range scanner by using your second button. This allows you to locate enemies before they get close, that way you can fly off and get them before they even have a shot at the outposts.

		<desc>1000 per word to have the compression done, so we tried to come up with a limited vocabulary which could be rearranged and reused as much as possible.There was some guy up in Silicon Gulch who did this stuff for a living - so it is possible to make money while talking in a monotone.".

The Artist Richard D. James, using his alter ego Caustic Window, has the sample : 'Humanoid must not escape' from this game in his song with the same name as the sample. It's from the album 'Caustic Window Compilation'.

Berzerk was also the first game to attempt a bit of on-screen comedy. Your robot opponents often fell foul of slapstick misfortune, shooting each other in the head or walking into walls and exploding in their attempts to kill you. And if you legged it out of a room without killing them all, the survivors would taunt you in their Speak &amp; Spell voices : "Chicken! Fight like a robot!". Okay, it's not hilarious, but even Bob Monkhouse had to start somewhere. Sometimes when you escape as above, it will just utter "Chicken".

'Evil Otto' was named for 'Dave Otto', who worked for Dave Nutting's Arcade Engineering group as R &amp; D director at the time Alan McNeil did. 'Evil Otto' can be considered one of the most intimidating video game villains of all time. He is, and even travels through walls, preventing a player from loafing in the room. He resembles a bouncing smiley face, and has been called a 'Malicious basketball' by some.

Berzerk was Stern's first major video game success. It was made in both upright (approx. 37500 units) and cocktail (approx. 1200 units) models. Berzerk suffered a bit in sales due to frequent breakdowns of it's original giant sized optical 8-way joystick. Approximately 4200 orders were canceled by distributors and operators whose machines were frequently down from the opto-stick. Stern issued free WICO leaf switch sticks to operators after they had so much trouble with the optical stick, but this still hurt sales.

Berzerk shares a rather chilling distinction of being the first known game to be blamed for an actual player's death. In January 1981, Jeff Dailey was the first person to die playing a video game, a 19-year old Berzerk player, died of a massive heart attack right after playing his favorite game. His score was 16,660 (a very respectable score but disturbing for obvious reasons). On an equally distressing note, in October 1982 at the 'Friar Tuck Game Room' in Calumet City, Illinois : 18-year old Peter Burkowski, a physically healthy person who was alcohol-free and drug-free, inscribed his initials in Berzerk's top ten list twice in a matter of only 15 minutes. A few seconds after that, he collapsed and died of a heart attack.
In Retrogamer Issue #47, Alan McNeil addressed these legends, and has a different perspective: "...one player did die while playing the game (Alan refutes reports that claim two died). The unfortunate fellow was obese and had run upstairs to play the game", Alan explains: "The legend is he set a high score and died, but the owner of the arcade said he didn't finish the game  he was out of breath from the moment he arrived until he dropped. The legend is way better than reality: the excitement of playing a game killing a player after setting a high score..."

Steve Wagner holds the official record for this game on the 'Fast Bullets' setting with 350340 points on March 12, 2009.
Phil Younger holds the official record for this game on the 'Slow Bullets' setting with 304570 points on August 12, 2007.

A Berzerk unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.
A Berzerk unit appears in the ZZ Top music video 'Legs'.

Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983. 'Can You Survive the Frenzied Attack of the Robot Army?' In this board game version, 2 players face off. One player controls the Humanoid and the other player controls Evil Otto and the robots. Players alternate sides for a maximum of three rounds or until both have been zapped three times and destroyed as the Humanoid. Humanoid lives are represented by chips placed in front of the player. Each time a player's Humanoid is zapped, the player surrenders one chip. Once a player loses all three chips, that player's Humanoid is destroyed, and therefore he/she cannot control the Humanoid for the rest of the game. The object of the game is to zap more robots while controlling the Humanoid than your opponent.

Berzerk inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Goin' Berzerk' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album, here are the full lyrics! :

Humanoid - This is you.  
You can move in eight directions.
Once you start you're never done.
You can go from room to room,
You can crawl or you can run.
You can wander through the maze.
It's a wonderland at night,
You can stop and aim your gun when,
there's a robot in your sights.

Robots - The various colored robots.
I think I'm going berzerk.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I'm getting lost in the shuffle.
It happens every time.
I think I'm going berzerk.
Would you like to come to?
I can't stop now - I'm addicted!
I'm berzerk over you.

Evil Otto - The bouncing smiley face.
If we fight this thing together
there's a chance that we might win.
Now here comes Evil Otto,
push the fire buttons in.
I'm sure he's crazy too because 
he's bouncing off the floor.
There's no way to destroy him , 
let him bounce right out the door.

The speech, 'Humanoid' and 'Intruder Alert!' featured heavily in 1988's seminal UK Acid track, 'Stakker Humanoid' by later Future Sound of London member Brian Dougans. His use of distortion and slightly lower pitch, leaves the game sounding quite tame by comparison...

		<name>Black Dragon (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Black Dragon is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a fantasy world and is the spiritual successor to the Capcom classic, "Makaimura" ("Ghosts'n' Goblins" outside Japan).

The player takes on the role of a barbarian hero who must jump and fight his way through a variety of colourful, enemy-packed levels, collecting treasure and weapon power-ups and rescuing the trapped 'wise old men' that litter the levels. 

Rescuing the wise men sees the player awarded 'Zeny coins'; these are the game's currency and allow the player to buy such items as weapon and armour upgrades, keys for treasure chests, anti-poisoning potions and health potions from the shops that appear on each level. Occasionally, a rescued wise man will also offer to sell the player weapon and armour power-ups. 

The barbarian hero is armed with a spiked mace on the end of a long chain, as well as unlimited throwing daggers. Both these and the armour worn by the barbarian (which offers limited protection from enemy attacks) can be upgraded by finding or buying the relevant power-ups.

The sprawling, eight-way scrolling levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage and reward exploration. These bonuses are in the form of weapon and armour power-ups, as well as valuable treasure items. Many levels also include a hidden dungeon and each dungeon is filled with both bonus items and trapped wise men.

Special items that reveal coins, upgraded armour, or simply bonus points can be found by attacking certain walls.

Egg - Grows to become hornet or spoiler. Must be pushed off the web to score 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, or even 2,500 points.
Grub Steak - Tag for 500, 250, 100, or 50 points -- the sooner the better.
Spoiler - Invulnerable. Can only be destroyed by a grenade bug, bug slayer or rocket bug.
Grenade Bug - Explodes if shot. Bugs and eggs within the kill zone score 500 points each.
Rocket Bug - Invulnerable. Launches "rockettes" at black widow from the other bugs it tags. Shoot rockettes to score 100 points each.
Thunderbug - If shot, it breaks formation and attacks. If shot again, it explodes all other T-bugs for 5000 points. Keep away from all T-bugs to earn 10,000 points. The resulting chain reaction from multiple thunderbugs is very dangerous and can encompass over 80% of the level at some times, depending on how many T-bugs are involved.
Bug Slayer - Harmless to the player and invulnerable. The Bug Slayer competes with the Black Widow for food. Beat it to its flashing prey for points

		<desc>This game was two player only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players character will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). The game ended after one player chalked up six wins, but this was operator adjustable down to as low as three.

		<desc>The object of BLUEPRINT is to accumulate points by finding the parts of your contraption hidden within each neighborhood and successfully placing them in their propper positions on the blueprint for the contraption. Once the contraption is rebuilt, players must use it to stop the persuit of Daisy Damsel by Ollie Ogre. By doing so they will score bonus points and uncover clues to the hidden Password.

In BLUEPRINT, you play the part of our gallant hero. You begin each game with three lives. The solid squares on the bottom of your screen indicate how many of your lives are left.

Use your Joystick Controller to enter each neighborhood you encounter and to move from house to house. Hold the Joystick with the red button to your upper left toward the screen. As you search for the parts to fit the blueprint, the red button acts as your speed control. Once your completed contraption is activated, however, the red button becomes your triggering device, enabling you to fire off a shot at meen old Ollie Ogre.

After having saved Daisy for the third time you will be awarded one extra life for being a true hero!

Your objective is to destroy with your sword all the crystal balls that are in the house, you must go through all the floors and go through the doors guided by the map at the top of the screen in a time limit without getting caught by the ghosts, frankenstein, witches and other creepy creatures. With the help of your magic glove can freeze ghosts for a short period of time to later hit them with the sword.

Once you've destroyed all the crystal balls, the haunted house starts falling apart, and you must run for your life towards the exit to win the stage. You can transform into a super hero, entering through the flashing door to grab special items.

		<name>Boot Hill </name>
		<desc>A classic 1 or 2-player western gunfight game, featuring a monochrome display overlaid via mirror onto back-lit plastic background. Each player uses a small joystick to move their cowboy up and down the play area, while a second, much larger joystick is used to aim the pistol and shoot - this larger stick also has a trigger button. The game's single goal is simply to shoot the other player, who is situated on the opposite side of the game area. Wagons and cacti litter the middle of the play area, providing temporary cover from the opponent's gunfire (while, of course, providing the opponent with cover from the PLAYER'S shots). These obstacles slowly disintegrate as they are shot; much like the shields in Taito's "Space Invaders".

Boot Hill is time-based NOT life based, with the factory default set at ninety seconds. This is, of course, operator adjustable via the dip settings. The computer opponent is quite easy to beat with a little practice, but a human opponent provides a much stronger challenge.

		<desc>Bosconian is a multi-directional space shooter where the player must destroy several enemy bases on each round while evading enemy ships, asteroids and mines. Enemy bases are destroyed either with a shot to the center or by shooting out all six base cannons. The player's ship is always positioned in the center of the screen with everything else scrolling around it as the player flies. A radar map to the right shows the position of the player, enemy bases, and occasional formation attack groups.

		<name>Bowl-O-Rama </name>
		<desc>This game has 3 different bowling variations to choose from 'Regulation Bowling', 'Flash-O-Matic', and 'BlackJack' :

* In 'Regulation Bowling' the rules and scoring are just like real bowling, following the regulations of the American Bowling Congress (ABC). In all three games players can join in at any time during the first frame.

* 'Flash-O-Matic' is a variation on the bowling theme. In this game a flashing score value moves back and forth across the alley. The player bowls, and the score value stops when the ball first hits a pin. If the player throws a strike he receives that score value. If he gets a spare he gets half the original value. If he fails to convert the spare then he gets 1 point for each pin that he did knock down. Scores can go up to nearly 10,000 points!

* In 'BlackJack' each player gets up to 3 throws to attempt to knock down 21 pins. Each time the full rack of ten pins is set. All pins knocked down by all players in one frame are added to the pot. The player who gets closest to 21 without going over gets all the points in the pot, and the pot is cleared to zero for the next frame. If a player gets 21 exactly then he gets twice the value in the pot. If 2 or more players tie in a frame they each get the points from the pot (or twice the points if they each have 21). Players who do not get closest to 21 or who bust (go over 21) get no points for the frame. Knocking down one pin scores as an ace, and is worth one or eleven, depending on what the player needs. his game is best played by several players together. The more players, the more points each frame is worth!

The cannon shoots fireballs from one end and has a boxing glove on an extension arm on the other end. The octagon is a protective wall for the cannon. Fireballs and the boxing glove pass over the wall to targets outside.
Bombs are randomly located outside the wall. Each bomb has a lite fuse. Three bugs are also randomly scattered outside the wall. The player's score, the number of cannons remaining, and the number of bugs that must be knocked out to complete the round are shown at the top of the screen.

		<desc>Canyon Bomber is a 2-D shooter. You control either the blimp or the plane while dropping bombs on the rocks below. Your goal is to get the highest amount of points (either against the computer or another player). You are allowed so many misses before your game ends. Misses are counted as the times you do not hit any rocks. The scores for the rocks are directly proportional to the difficulty in hitting those rocks. This game boils down to precision bombing and thinking ahead as to where the next bomb will fall. Good luck in taking out all of the rocks in the canyon.

		<name>Carnival (upright) </name>
		<desc>CARNIVAL is a 1 or 2 player alternate action game that simulates a carnival shooting gallery. The playfield consists of three target rows, a rotating pipe wheel, a bonus message panel, and a 'special' target block.

The player uses a left right control to position a rifle at the bottom of the screen, and a shoot control to fire the rifle. Two rows of bullets at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of shots remaining to the player. Every time the player shoots, one of the bullets disappears from the screen. More bullets are given during the first round than the others, so, the inexperienced player will have a chance to enjoy the play.

The game ends when the player runs out of bullets. This can occur on any round. A round ends when the player clears the playfield of all targets. At this point, a special 'shoot the bear' sequence appears, and when this is finished the player proceeds to the next more difficult (and higher scoring) round. This is Gremlin's Multi-Phase design concept that keeps games challenging to players of all levels.

When a player completes a round (ending with 'shoot the bear' sequence), the screen flips to the other player. When the original player resumes play, he advances to the next level of difficulty, exactly as he would have if the screen had not flipped to the other player. This method allows the players to more directly compare their scores, since they are always within one round of each other. Note that the player who ends the game first does not necessarily lose--he might still have the higher score when the game ends.

The three target rows move in a horizontal line from left to right (top row), right to left (middle row) and left to right (bottom row). There are five types of targets. The rows move as a continuous band--the targets exiting the playfield from the right side of the bottom row reappear at the left of the top row. The point value for hitting a row target is indicated along the right side of the game--maximum points for a top row target, medium points for a middle row target, and minimum points for a bottom row target. These values increase from round to round.

Rabbits and owls are simple targets, which disappear when hit.

Numbered sign targets award additional bullets to the player when hit, as well as awarding the points indicated for the row. These targets appear only on the top two rows to make them relatively difficult targets.

Five small letters, B, 0, N, U and S are randomly interspersed through the target rows. At the upper right of the playfield is the word ''bonus" spelled out is small letters. If the player manages to hit the moving bonus letters in order (b-o-n-u-s) a special bonus is awarded. The fact that the bonus is still active is shown by the bonus word in the upper right of the playfield. Every time a bonus letter in the correct order is hit, the small corresponding letter in the bonus panel enlarges to show that it has been hit. Whenever a bonus letter is hit out of order, the bonus panel disappears until the next round. The bonus panel reappears at the beginning of every round. The bonus value is determined by adding row target points into the bonus value. When the "B" letter is hit, the bonus value freezes for that round. This encourages waiting as long as possible before attempting to score the bonus.

Ducks are special targets. Whenever a duck reaches the bottom row, it is capable of leaving the row and flying down toward the player. If the duck manages to get past the player's rifle without being shot, it flies down to the bullet row and quickly eats 10 bullets. A maximum of three ducks can escape simultaneously.

The target rows move as a continuous band of targets, and no new owls, rabbits, or bonus letter targets are added once the round starts. 'More shots' targets and ducks are added during a round. The frequency of adding duck targets is tied to the round number. As the rounds get more difficult, more ducks are added as the round progresses.

A flying duck hit scores no points.

Bullets left over at the end of a round earn 50 points each.

The between rounds 'shoot the bear' sequence operates as a shooting gallery bear. Whenever the bear is hit, it rears up, roars, and continues motion in the opposite direction. Each hit speeds up the bear, and increases the point value, which is shown above the bear for each hit. When the bear leaves the screen (which it will always do eventually, since it speeds up with each hit) the between rounds sequence ends and a new round begins. As the rounds progress, more bears (a maximum of 4) appear on the screen simultaneously.

A special yellow-rimmed score panel appears in the upper left of the playfield, and stays on for random lengths of time. Four types of panels appear here, which either add or subtract points or bullets. Hitting any part of the panel border awards the score shown inside.

The bullet bonus panel is shown with a large plus sign, and a row of bullets. Immediately after appearing, the bullets begin disappearing fairly rapidly. When the bullets are depleted, the panel disappears. If hit, the player is awarded the number of bullets left in the panel when it was hit.

The score bonus is shown with the same large plus sign, and a score value. As with the bullets, the score value quickly decreases, until it hits zero and disappears.

The minus panels are similar to those above except a large minus sign indicates the number of bullets or points subtracted when hit. This discourages the practice of parking on the left margin and shooting--a miss will hit the negative target. These panels show a fixed number of bullets or points, and after a random time interval, disappear.

The pipe wheel contains 8 pipes of 4 different colors. A panel beneath the wheel restricts pipe hits to horizontally oriented pipes, and also indicates the point value for hitting a pipe. Every shot the player takes decrements the pipe value, except a shot which hits a pipe. This makes it advisable to hit pipes early in the round, when it is most difficult (since the player must shoot through heavily populated target rows). Hitting two pipes of the same color with two consecutive shots awards a bonus of four times the pipe value shown in the panel.

CARNIVAL is accompanied by background music. At the beginning of every round, the music begins at a slow rate and relatively low key. As the round progresses, the music speeds up and the melody shifts up in key. This gives the player a growing sense of urgency. As the round progresses, the playfield motion also gradually speeds up.

A small panel on the right of the playfield contains a musical note symbol. If the player wishes to turn off the music, he simply shoots the note panel. This makes the note disappear, and turns off the music. Hitting the panel again makes the note reappear and resumes the music. The note thus acts as a 'flip-flop' switch to turn the music on and off.

Every round begins with the music on.

There is a special case to consider near the end of a round: the player has cleared all of the targets except the ducks, and has plenty of bullets left so that he can simply sit and wait for the ducks. He would, in effect, prolong the game by refusing to end the round.

Theoretically, by hitting the ducks and 'more shots' signs, the round could be prolonged indefinitely. However, an internal "doomsday" timer in the game keeps track of how long a round has lasted. After a certain time limit (the same for each round), the frequency of new duck appearances increases dramatically.

The top 3 scores are shown during advertising, along with the player's initials. A player who scores in the top 3 is allowed to enter 3 initials by a special routine explained at the time of their writing. The rank is updated during the round. The player is both audibly and visually rewarded. There is a pronounced audible sound as the player's score passes that of another ranking player's score. And, they may watch their rank progress during the game.

CARNIVAL's basic play action is outlined below, as it appears in the game instructions.

Shoot all targets and pipes to advance to the next round.
Game is over when you run out of bullets.
Escaped ducks eat 10 bullets.
Hit B-O-N-U-S letters in sequence for special bonus. Bonus value stops increasing when 'B' is hit.
Hit same color pipes with 2 consecutive shots to score 4 times pipe value. Shoot number signs for more bullets.
Shoot the bear between rounds for extra points.

		<desc>4 billion worth of quarters now. It's still one heck of an industry." 

* Popular from the Start : The prototype games were hand-built, wire-wrapped, one-of-a kinds that were created by the development team prior to ordering the circuit boards for the mass-produced versions. With just a single machine, people would come in at all hours of the night to play a new game. 

Dan Plishkin : 'One of the things that kind of allowed everybody at Atari to have kind of a loose and enjoyable relationship was that management was kind of loose, too. An example of that happened with one of Howard Delman's games. I can't remember which one it was, but we sent the one and only prototype wire-wrapped version of Howie's game off to the AMOA (Amusement and Music Operators Association) show with strict orders not to sell it.' 

Of course the game was sold anyway, and a new prototype had to be assembled back at the labs. Dan Plishkin continued : 'Several months later Howie gets a call from the person who bought this game. It had stopped collecting money and he wanted to know how to change the settings to make it play longer, or something, to see if it would earn more money. Howie had to tell the guy that if it ever collected any money at all, it was a miracle because it didn't have any coin routines at all. It had none, because we had wired it for free-play when we sent it to the AMOA show!' 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Especially in the early 1980s a great many newspaper and magazine articles were written about the meaning of and possible consequences of the wave of video games that seemed to allure so many kids, and adults, to the arcades. But at the heart of it might have been the promise of a quick escape into another world. 

Rich Adam : "I kind of figured out, maybe years after the fact, what I think the lure of video games is. It's because people have so little control over their lives. This is especially true with kids, but even adults often have little control over the day-to-day part of their lives. You have to go to work. You don't get to control that much of your life. But for a quarter you can control this very complex machine. You can command it. For a quarter that's quite a bargain, to be able to do that for five minutes... When you're good at a game it gives you an incredible sense of power over the whole environment.". 

Centipede was the 1st UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) approved game. 

Jim Schneider holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 16,389,547 points on August 1, 1984. 

Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 7,111,111 points on November 5, 2000. 

Note 1 : The upright side artwork features a grasshopper, while it is not present during game-play. In test mode you can cycle through the different graphical objects used in the game (the player, a mushroom, a spider, a scorpion, a flea and a grasshopper). Grasshopper?! Yes, the game was to originally have had grasshoppers but they were taken out. You can still see them in the test however. 

Note 2 : 'Centipede' is also the name of a terrifying, man-eating monster of the size of a mountain. This Japanese legend say that the dragon king of that particular lake asked the famous hero Hidesato to kill it for him. The hero slew it by shooting an arrow, dipped in his own saliva, into the brain of the monster. The dragon king rewarded Hidesato by giving him a rice-bag; a bag of rice which could not be emptied and it fed his family for centuries. 

Centipede inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Ode To A Centipede' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including CENTIPED. 

A Centipede unit appears in the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", in the 1983 movie "WarGames", in the 1983 movie "James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again", in the 1983 movie "Joysticks", in the 1984 movie "Body Double", in the 1985 movie "Teen Wolf", in the 1986 movie "Running Scared", in the 1987 movie "Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown", in the 1995 movie "Species" and in the 1996 movie 'House Arrest'. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of twelve collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight". 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on Atari's Centipede. 

A Reimagined version of the Centipede franchise, was launched for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii under name of "Centipede Infestation".

		<name>Challenger </name>
		<desc>CHALLENGER is the newest video game to be introduced by Centuri. With its vivid colors and lively setting, it is sure to lure the most ardent player into game action.

The game consists of 16 sectors (rounds) of play. Sector 1 begins with Large Energy Rings floating randomly across the screen. The Spaceship must avoid colliding with the Rings, or it will explode into a starburst of brilliant colors. The Spaceship dodges the Energy Rings by moving right or left across the playfield, while bursting them with the Spaceship's 3-directional guns. Bursting the Large Rings (100 points) breaks them into Medium Rings. Bursting the Medium Rings (200 points) breaks them into Small Rings. Bursting the Small Rings (400 points) causes them to disintegrate.

The Spaceship is further protected by a feature called a 'Warp' button. By depressing this button, the Spaceship will relocate from the top or bottom of the screen to the opposite side.

If the Spaceship is in ultimate danger of being destroyed, releasing its Super Bomb will wipe out all the objects on the playfield, and add the point value of the objects to your score. Use of the Super Bomb is lost, if the ship is destroyed first. Only one Super Bomb is awarded per Spaceship.

At any time, a colorful Space Bogey resembling a Worm may appear on screen and proceed to chase the Spaceship. If the Worm is destroyed by Spaceship fire, or dodged successfully for several seconds, a 'clang' is heard and the Worm (500 points) wriggles off the screen in a bright red hue of embarrassment. If the Spaceship is caught by the Worm, a bell is sounded, and the astronaut is chased out of his ship in pursuit of safety.

At random time intervals a Bonus Bug will walk across the playfield, stop, and count down a Bonus Number. This number is equal to 100 times its value. To receive this Bonus, the Spaceship must link with the nose of the Bonus Bug.

When the Spaceship has survived 50 Seconds of playing time, it now enters the challenges of the next sector.

The remaining 15 sectors are played in the same manner as Sector one. The differences include that each succeeding sector increases in difficulty. The Energy Rings increase in number and move faster across the screen making them harder to dodge. Also there are several Space Bogeys introduced in the first 8 sectors. They also increase in number with advancement through each sector. Some of the Space Bogeys resemble Comets whizzing through space. Others resemble Spaceships from other worlds. Each Space Bogey (500 points), is an assemblage of bright colors, and when destroyed, burst with a "clang" into a spray of bright light.

Sectors 4, 8, 12, and 16, are alike as follows. A few seconds after the Energy Rings are broken into smaller pieces, they are pulled into a Black Hole in the center of the screen. While swirling across the game area, the condensed Rings expand and shatter into fragments which must be destroyed before they absorb the Spaceship.

When Sector 16 has been accomplished, it will return to Sector 9.

When Bonus levels are achieved, an additional Ship will be added to your game.

CHALLENGER INSTRUCTIONS
1. Burst energy rings to score and increase bonus levels.
Large rings - 100 points
Medium rings - 200 points
Small rings - 400 points
2. After all the small rings are hit, advance to the next sector.
3. In each sector, space bogeys appear and score 500 points when hit.
4. When the bonus bug walks across the playfield and stops, bonus points are counted down. To collect the bonus, link the ship with nose of the bug.
5. Pressing the warp button immediately relocates the ship from the top or bottom of the playfield to the opposite side.
6. The Super Bomb button destroys all objects on the playfield screen and awards total point value to your score.
7. One Super Bomb is awarded per ship.  Use of it will be lost if the ship is destroyed first.	
8. Game is over when all the ships have been destroyed.

Now possessing superior physical strength and agility, Chelnov is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home, and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes this game from others of its genre is its use of forced scrolling. The screen moves continuously from left to right and players must negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without the benefit of dictating their speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above and below and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies carry different types of weapons and power-ups and when they are shot the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.

		<name>Chimera Beast (prototype) </name>
		<desc>A horizontally scrolling shoot'em up where 1 or 2 players control creatures known as 'eaters' which are capable of eating other creatures and taking their DNA, thus acquiring their abilities or characteristics.

Chimera Beast takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by animals known as eaters, capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of evolution, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player's creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet's humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, will eventually make their way to Earth.

The chief innovation of Chimera Beast is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player's eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a poisonous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon.

Another difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player's eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well.

It is the home conversion of their own arcade game released back in 1988 - however, this PC Engine version could easily be seen as a sequel (both games do share a lot in common but levels layout and the overall design are very different). The game features a boy riding on a magic cloud who embarks on a journey to free his cute friend. The poor girl has been kidnaped by some evil magic forces and was imprisoned inside a large crystal ball. Weird mythological creatures and other flying cakes and buns try to stop our hero and prevent him to reach his goal. Thankfully, formation of flying dumplings often hide power-ups which either increase our hero's fire power, get him to fly quicker or just make him invincible for a short period of time. Also, special cloud riding enemies are scattered around each stage and reveal magic doors when defeated. These doors lead to shops where a cute shopkeeper provides free secondary magic weapons. Yes, you read it well, no money involved here, everything is free, but our hero can only use one magic weapon at the time. At the end of each area, our friend flies over the clouds and get to fight an obligatory end-of-stage boss.

		<desc>The object of Clay Pigeon was to shoot as many clay targets as you can, using an arcade light gun that was shaped like a shotgun. At the start of the game you are given the choice of selecting either Trap Shooting or Skeet Shooting. Trap shooting is where the clay target is thrown directly away from the shooter, while in skeet shooting the target is launched across the shooter's field of vision. The graphics are done in Exidy's realistic style, each round is played against a decent looking outdoor background, and an extremely repetitive announcer yells 'pull' to warn you of each and every target being launched. After several rounds of targets, you finally get to go after some real live animals! The real live animals are of course, ducks! The ducks are small and fly onto the screen in small groups of up to around a half dozen or so, and unlike the earlier title "Vs. Duck Hunt", you cannot miss any of these. Missing any ducks in this round ends the game instantly, and will more than likely have you fumbling for another quarter in an attempt to do it right this time.

		<name>Cloak &amp; Dagger (rev 5) </name>
		<desc>Agent X, complete with trenchcoat, Bogie hat, and briefcase, hurries through a series of adventures and misadventures to retrieve stolen plans and destroy dastardly Dr. Boom's subterranean bomb factory. Our masked hero descends to the depths of Dr. Boom's laboratory in a special elevator. On each floor he encounters a series of conveyor belts that are moving explosives. A giant bomb ticks down the game seconds while devices of Dr. Boom's plotting, such as bomb converters, forklifts deflecting shots back at Agent X, robot guards, acid pits, and crawling eyes shooting death rays, challenge the player(s).

CLOAK &amp; DAGGER is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster video display. You control Agent X as he descends underground floor by floor in an elevator to Dr. Boom's lab, located on the 33rd floor. Your main goal is to retrieve Top Secret plans that are surrounded by an electrical arc. To stop the electrical current, Agent X must shoot all the fiery nodes as he fights off robot guards.

As Agent X leaves the elevator on each floor, he must make his way carefully and quickly across the screen to another exit. Each floor displays a configuration of conveyor belts moving green unarmed and red armed explosives.  Agent X can pick up the green explosives. The red explosives will explode on contact. Some floors have marauding robot guards, death-ray shooting crawling eyes, and acid pits.

Once Agent X has the top secret plans in hand, he must make his way back to the surface. If he exits on a floor that was bombed on the way down, he will find a massive crater protected by node monsters and the previously mentioned attackers. If he exits on a floor that was not bombed, a superguard will join the other attackers to challenge Agent X. On the final level, rumors are that he will meet the notorious Dr. Boom himself.

At the center of the display, a double-coiled fuse to a giant bomb is ticking down the game seconds for each level. Agent X can light the fuse in a rush for bonus points, but must be able to escape that level before the bomb explodes. If the fuse has shortened on its own to one coil, it lights automatically and prompts Agent X to make a mad dash to the waiting elevator. The doors close just as a burst of light from the explosion is seen. The game's perspective now changes to a full view inside the elevator. Messages flash across the elevator to give helpful hints on the next level.

Dr. Boom has placed explosive mines on every 4th floor. On each of the preceding 3 floors Agent X can pick up a secret map box that will show him part of the safe path across the minefield on the next 4th floor.

Agent X's first goal is to travel successfully from one elevator to the other; his second goal is to pick up a secret box to get a map of the minefield on levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32; the third goal is to light the bomb fuse and escape before the explosion.

As game play progresses, Agent X may find an extra-life box and a mystery box that give bonus points, double speed, half speed, and occasionally, an extra life. Extra bonus points are earned for picking up green unarmed explosives or for skipping floors.

If Agent X succeeds in capturing the top secret plans, he must fight his way back up to the top level. The appearance of box compressors, crawling eyes, and other enemies are more random on the way up than on the way down. If Agent X makes it back to the surface, a free game will be awarded (depending on the settings of the option switches).

The game ends when you use up your last life or successfully make it to the surface.

		<desc>This game was for two or four players only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players character will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponents before hitting something. Each player is eliminated when they crash, taking their lines with them. One good strategy is to turn around and head for the outer area of the screen (in four player mode), because everyone starts out headed for the center. Skirt around the edges until you only have one opponent left, then box them in. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own line, so avoid that at all cost.

		<desc>In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)
Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)
Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)
Stage 06: Core of Base 2 (3D fixed)
Stage 07: Snow Field (horizontal scroll)
Stage 08: Energy Zone (horizontal scroll)
Stage 09: Hangar (horizontal scroll)
Stage 10: Alien Lair (horizontal scroll)

		<desc>Contra is a side scrolling action game by Konami and based on the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1987. In 2631, a mysterious meteoroid containing extraterrestrial life crashed through Earth's atmosphere and landed in New Zealand, near a group of islands. Two years later, a terrorist group organization known as the Red Falcon appears near the impact site and threatens to plunge humanity into destruction and chaos. The evil military group is believed to be helped by a malevolent alien race whose only purpose is to conquer the universe, and two elite commando marines (Bill Rizer and Lance Bean) are dispatched on a life-or-death mission to save the world. The fighters have the ability to jump, crouch, fire in eight directions and also move while using a weapon. They however have no shield energy nor life bar, and die in one hit. But the meat of the game lies elsewhere. Contra is popularly known for its serious fire-power on display, and although players start their mission equipped with a basic and ordinary rifle gun, more sophisticated and destructive weapons can be obtained throughout the game. Various large containers stamped with Red Falcon insignias on them release all kind of weapons with limitless ammo - Flamethrower (F), Laser Gun (L), Machine Gun (M) and 5-way Spread Gun (S). Special icons also give the players additional abilities, such as Rapid Fire (R) which increases the weapon's rate of fire, and the Barrier (B) which turns the player invincible for a short amount of time. Interestingly, although most of the game is played in a traditional 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay, the second and fourth levels switch to a 3D over-the-shoulder corridor perspective, and ask the players to fight their way through heavily defended rooms and corridors. Contra includes a two-player cooperative mode.

The screen is an overhead view of a city street, with the cops on one side, and the robbers on the other. Each car is in it's own lane, and an extra wide lane marks the area between the cop and robber side. Each player can move up and down in their own lane, the object is to shoot down the cars of the opposite side. A beer truck moves randomly up and down the center lane, generally getting in the way.

		<desc>Strap on your vector spacesuit, and hop into your vector spaceship. It is a good old ship, and it has seen a lot of action. From navigating the asteroid belt and blasting aliens around the sun, to attacking evil space cannons, your little vector ship has done it all, and this time it has been upgraded with twin blasters. You see the ship in Cosmic Chasm seems to be the same spaceship that is in every vector game. You control it using rotation buttons and a thruster button, with a laser and a shield button thrown in for good measure, just like almost every other vector game around.

Now here is what you have to do. You guide your ship through a space fortress room by room. Each room contains a center section that slowly grows and will eventually trap you if you are not fast enough. You can shoot the center section to slow its growth. Each room also contains several exits. One of the exits will always spew forth a bunch of bad guys, shoot them, then exit to go to a different room. Between rooms you get to see an excellent tunnel animation. The idea is to make your way to the center of the fortress, blast the power core, and then leave. There is a map at the top of the screen to keep you from getting lost. This is a pretty decent game. It has a lot more to offer than the one screen of bad guys that most vector games have.

		<name>Cosmo Gang the Video (US) </name>
		<desc>Cosmo Gang the Video is the conversion of Namco's arcade game. The game is highly inspired by Galaga, ultra famous shooter released by the same company in 1981. This version, however, features cute colorful graphics and froggy like characters instead of the traditional alien flying saucers. Formations of flying pink frogs and other weird aliens fill-up the screen and the player's task is to clean the whole thing up. Power-ups have also been added to the mix : shields, a jack-in-the-box that freezes everything on the screen for a limited amount of time, mine fields and giant-webs to slow down all enemies on the screen. The game counts five worlds and each of them features five sub-stages - the player simply needs to clean up all the baddies in each of them to jump to the next stage. A Challenge Stage awaits at the end of each world - in there, the player has to prevent the froggy like characters from stealing precious items, from mysterious crates to bags of gold. The only real boss of the game, Boss Cosmo, awaits at the end of the game after completing the fifth world. A two simultaneous player mode is available.

		<name>Cosmo Police Galivan (12/16/1985) </name>
		<desc>Galivan is a single player platform shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the roll of a 'Cosmo Police' officer who runs and jumps around a multi-directional scrolling cave system, destroying or avoiding waves of constantly attacking robots, aliens and alien ships.

The player starts the game as an unarmed human, whose only attacking options are kicking and punching, but picking up a POW item encases the human in a robotic suit and arms the player with a laser gun.

Collecting the blue POW items while in the suit awards the player with a powerful beam weapon for a limited time, while the red POW item gives the player a three-shot cannon. POW items are dotted throughout the levels and can also be gained by shooting the blue robot aliens.

The player's character has an energy bar that decreases whenever the player is hit. Should this fall below the halfway point, the robot suit will be lost and the player will once again be an unarmed human.

Collecting a POW item while in human form will restore the player's energy. If a POW is collected while wearing the suit, however, the player's energy will NOT be increased but their weapon will receive a power-up.

The game's platforms are littered with springboards that fire the player high into the air when stepped on. Some platforms - often containing POW items - can only be reached via a springboard.

		<desc>Depthcharge is a 2-Dimensional shooter. You control your destroyer on the surface of the water while submarines patrol underneath. Your job is to drop depth charges to eliminate these submarines. The submarines aren't defenseless as they launch mines straight up toward your ship.

Depthcharge was one of the early video games. Action was simple. This game also had the ability to retain the highest score (without the initials of course). Although the game is simple in concept, just trying to get enough points was enough to keep you working at it. Good luck on your submarine hunting mission.

		<name>Diamond Run </name>
		<desc>An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is littered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player's path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player.

In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave.

Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star's Commodore C64 classic, 'Boulder Dash'.

		<desc>The player controls Domino Man, a bespectacled, moustachioed artist who must set up a chain of giant dominoes across the screen, to form a chain of dominoes which can then be toppled.

The dominoes must be placed on sites marked by black spots, achieved by simply running over each spot. Once all of the spots are covered with a domino, the chain is complete. The player will then have the choice of either knocking them all down to clear the level, or simply wait for a few seconds to continue to the next screen, in hope of completing the chain on THAT level, and so on. In this way, the player can set up several chains and knock them all down in one fell swoop, earning many bonus points in the process. Multiple chains are, of course, very difficult to achieve.

Domino Man's progress is hampered by a neighborhood bully who walks onto the screen and tries to knock over the first dominoes he comes across. The player must either try to complete and topple the chain of dominoes before the bully knocks them over, or hit the bully with a domino; causing the bully's trousers to fall down and disabling him for a few seconds. A killer bee also appears, and if it manages to sting the player, a life is lost. A bag lady and a boy pushing a shopping cart wander blindly around the levels, occasionally knocking over some of the dominoes. Domino Man can hit them, however, causing them to change direction.

Once a game is over, a poem is displayed on-screen to evaluate the player's performance on the game. For example :
Roses are red
Or so goes the verse,
You set up fifty-two
You could have done worse.

		<name>Donkey Kong 3 (Japan) </name>
		<desc>The third and final arcade outing for Donkey Kong sees the giant ape once again cast as the enemy. Unlike the first two Donkey Kong games, the legendary character Mario is not featured in this game. Instead, the player takes on the role of Stanley the Bugman, a gardener who is armed with a bug spray with which he must destroy the swarms of insects that attack him and try to steal his plants. 

Each level has five plants that must be protected. Stanley must also spray Kong to force the ape to the top of the screen and complete the level. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Stanley - Stanley's job is to defend the greenhouse that Donkey Kong has invaded. He does this with his trusty bug spray. When Stanley pumps his spray can, the spray travels a certain distance before dissipating so it's not useful against targets that are far away. Stanley primarily uses his bug spray to zap bugs or to make Donkey Kong scoot up the vines that he holds onto. In order to complete each stage, Stanley's goal is to either push Donkey Kong all the way up the vine using bug spray, or defeat every insect present in that stage. There are many ways for Stanley to lose a life, including touching an insect, getting shot by any of the bee stingers, running out of time, or allowing Donkey Kong to slip off the bottom of the vine. 

Donkey Kong - Nintendo's favorite simian seems to have been working out a little bit compared to his previous appearances. Donkey Kong attempts to keep himself above harm's way by hanging onto two vines that descend from the greenhouse ceiling. If left alone, Donkey Kong slips down the vines little by little, hoping to land on Stanley by surprise. Occasionally, he will reach over to one of the two beehives along side him and tap them in order to send more bees after Stanley. In the yellow stages, he even grabs coconuts from time to time and lobs them at Stanley's head. Starting in round 15, he will throw coconuts at you regardless of the stage. 

Super Spray - One time for every one of Stanley's lives, a more powerful bug spray will be perched on Donkey Kong's right vine. When Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough so that his hand is touching the spray, the spray falls to the ground, at which time Stanley can pick it up. The Super Spray lasts for a number of seconds, and continues with Stanley to the next stage until the full time runs out. When this spray is activated, Donkey Kong is forced up the vines much faster, Creepies die when hit, and Queen Bees die in one hit. It will not be replenished after it runs out until Stanley loses a life, so it's not a good idea to plan your strategy around it's use. 

Beespy &amp; Buzzbee - These bugs are the primary attack force of the hive. Stanley starts the game squaring off against the Beespies as they swoop down and try to steal Stanley's vegetables. Starting in round 12, the hive switches to their faster and more aggressive soldiers, the Buzzbees. Buzzbees strike at Stanley more directly than Beespies. Either bee may or may not be accompanying a Queen Bee, but they are dangerous either way. 

Queen Bees - Starting in round 3, the Queen Bees of the hive will from time to time enter the fray surrounded by their royal escorts. One shot isn't enough to do them in, it simply changes them from red to blue. Even after you shoot them a second time, the threat isn't over. When killed, they split up in to 4 tiny projectiles that can kill you if they connect. You are only safe directly beneath them when they die. 

Buttifly &amp; Beetle - Starting in round 6, the Buttiflies escape from the hive. They fly down along the side of the screen until they are even with Stanley, pause for a brief moment, and then charge across the screen in an attempt to collide with him. They disappear after round 16, only to be replaced with Beetles in round 18, who are bigger and a bit harder to dodge. Beetles do not pause as Buttiflies do, and attack immediately. 

Moth - The Moth is the mercenary of the bee hive, employed from round 24 and on. They move erratically, so it's slightly difficult to predict where they are going to end up. They will occasionally attack Stanley, or they will swoop down for his vegetables. Don't let them distract you from your efforts to force Donkey Kong up the vine, but don't get in their way either, or let them fly away with your plants. 

Creepy - This worm likes to play interference. In the blue and gray stages, he crawls down to the platforms from the plants along the side of the screen. Once he reaches the platform, he will wiggle back and forth and make a nuisance of himself. He cannot be killed by the normal bug spray, but he is quite allergic to it, and spraying him causes him to stop in his tracks until he finishes coughing. He can be persuaded to climb back up the plant for a while if you blast him with spray before he reaches the platforms. In yellow stages, three or more Creepies will slide along the vines below Donkey Kong and try to get in the way of your bug spray. If you hit one, not only with it absorb the spray, but you'll have to wait for it to finish coughing before he will move on and allow you to shoot Kong. They can be killed by super spray. 

Beebomb - After an insect successfully steals one of your plants, it turns into a Beebomb. Beebombs circle around a few times near the hive that they came from, and then immediately dive bomb towards Stanley. They are incredibly fast when diving towards you, but due to their direct attack nature, they are easy to defeat as long as you keep your eyes on them and time a blast of bug spray just as they are about to hit you. 

Vine Eater - These creatures appear when the bonus timer runs out. When the timer reaches zero, two of these appear on either side of the screen. They are oblivious to bug spray. When they reach the vines, they eat the vine from the bottom up to the ceiling. If they eat the section of vine that Donkey Kong is holding on to, Donkey Kong falls down and Stanley loses a life just as if he had allowed Donkey Kong to drop off the vine himself.

		<name>Double Dragon (bootleg with HD6309) </name>
		<desc>Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.

Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: 
* Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.
* Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.
* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).
* Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.
* Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.
* Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. 
* Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.

		<name>Dragon Saber </name>
		<desc>Dragon Saber is a vertical shooter by Namco and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990, itself sequel of "Dragon Spirit". The game takes place far into the future, at a time when humanity's growing egoism and lack of respect for life and nature causes chaos on the Earth, slowly leading to its inevitable destruction. Monsters and evil creatures now roam the planet and in a desperate plea for help, the Sun goddess Aria asks two courageous knights, Huey and Siria, to go on the most perilous mission ever undertaken by mortals. Armed with a magical saber and the power to transform into fire breathing dragons, the warriors embark on a heroic journey to save the world. Dragon Saber follows the precedent established by its predecessor - players are able to hit enemies in the air as well as on the ground, and colored eggs scattered around each level gives them the opportunity to increase their dragon's firepower (blue egg) or base damage (red egg). However, the game offers some new features over its prequel - each player can now charge up powerful blasts of energy (by releasing the fire button for a few seconds) and different kinds of dragon power-ups have made their appearances, such as lightning bolts or Energy Wings, each one with their own super attack! Dragon Saber consists of eight levels and features a two-player simultaneous option.

		<name>Dragonninja (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Dragonninja is a sideways scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players in which the US president, President Ronnie (based on ex-U.S. president, Ronald Reagan), has been abducted by the nefarious DragonNinja clan.

Players take on the role of two government agents - 'Blade' and 'Striker' - who must fight their way through 7 enemy-packed levels to defeat the DragonNinja and save the President.

Each stage must be completed with a set time limit and initially the agents can only punch, kick and jump, although they can execute powerful spinning kicks and have the ability to charge themselves up with "inner energy" - by holding the punch button - to throw a powerful, long-range flaming punch that hits all opponents in front of the player.

Players will also come across weapon power-ups in the form of knives and Nunchuks. Player health can be replenished by picking up the drinks cans (resembling Coco-Cola cans) that also occasionally appear. Clocks can also be picked up to extend the stage's time limit.

At the end of each stage, players must defeat powerful end-of-level bosses, the first of which is Karnov, who was the star of his own 1987 video game of the same name.

For the game's 7th and final stage, players must re-fight all of the bosses from the previous stages, before finally confronting the Dragon Ninja himself. Defeating the Dragon Ninja frees the U.S. president and the game is over.

		<desc>The player takes on the role of a rookie cop in this sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up from Sega. A powerful crime syndicate is creating chaos in the cop's home city and he must prove his ability as a police officer by capturing a number of crime bosses, killing as many of their henchmen as possible in the process. The policeman carries a standard issue pistol which only has a limited amount of ammunition. In the event of the ammunition running out, players will only be able to kick their enemies. Extra Ammo can be picked up at various points in the levels.

As the player progresses through the game and makes more and more arrests, their on-screen character will be promoted through the ranks. First to Captain, then Assistant Chief, Chief and finally, once three crime bosses have been arrested, to a full E-SWAT agent. Adorning full, robot-style body armour that bears more than a passing resemblance to the "Robocop" character from the games and movies of the same name. In armoured mode, the cop has vastly increased firepower, including a limited number of bombs that are ejected by a mechanical device on the policeman's back.

As the armoured cop is shot, his armour will gradually disappear until he is finally killed.

E-Swat plays very much like a cross between Sega's own 1987 classic "Shinobi", as well as Namco's superb "Rolling Thunder".

		<desc>Enduro Racer is an off-road racing game in which players ride a dirt bike across five extremely hilly and twisting courses. Each course is littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over or avoided.

Jumps can only be performed at specific locations on each track. These locations feature a dirt ramp that spreads across the width of the track. Players must have the bike in the 'wheelie' position when the ramp is struck, the bike will then be launched into the air. If the bike is not in a wheelie position when the ramps are struck, the bike will still clear the ramp, but will land front-wheel first and crash.

Enduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.

		<name>Exed Exes </name>
		<desc>Exed Exes is a vertical shooter by Tokuma Shoten and conversion of an arcade game originally released by Capcom in 1985. The game takes place in the midst of a raging war - insect like creatures called the Exes have invaded Neg-Nin, a far distant planet in a remote galaxy, thousands of light years away from Earth. Scientists on Neg-Nin started to build a warship in reaction to the sudden bug invasion. The fighter comes equipped with a particle cannon which can be upgraded to double or triple laser beams by collecting special Pow icons dotted around each level. Unlike most other shooters of its kind, upgrades in Exed Exes are not cumulative, and specific Pow icons power-up the craft to the lowest, middle or highest power level (some, called woP even downgrade the main weapon). The ship comes with a limited amount of Mega Crush bombs that clear all enemy bullets from the screen. Levels follow a traditional structure, with waves of all kind of multicolored insects (bees, beetles, flies, dragonflies), large bugs and ground cannons that relentlessly bombard the player. Also, through several levels, the player automatically enters bonus phases called Hi-Point Areas. The background turns black and different types of enemies (usually skulls) slowly move down the screen. They can easily be destroyed, but collecting special Pow icons instantly turns them into fruits for extra points. Each level ends with a boss battle, and each one of them is made out of different components (skulls, guns and flashing cores) that need to be destroyed in order to proceed to the next stage. Exed Exes features a two-player simultaneous option.

		<desc>Exerion is a top-down vertical shooter by Jaleco and conversion of an arcade game originally released in 1982. In the year 2991, the Zorni forces launched a surprise attack on planet Exerion and the Fighter EX is sent to counter the threat. Hordes of attacking ships appear from the top of the screen, periodically shooting or diving down towards the player's ship. The space fighter comes equipped with two weapons - a standard twin-shot and a rapid fire. Although the slow twin-shot comes in unlimited supply, the powerful rapid fire is limited to a certain amount of ammo (the remaining rapid shots are called 'charges' and are displayed at the bottom of the screen). As the player kills enemies, the amount of rapid fire shots slowly increases, and the core of the gameplay is to find the perfect balance between the slow but wide twin-shot, and the fast but limited rapid fire. Although the game borrows many elements from popular top-down shooters available the time (such as Galaxian or Phoenix), it separates itself from its peers for a number of reasons. First of all, the background features a pseudo perspective and a 3D/Parallax scrolling that smoothly transitions from one area to the next. Then the ship has considerable inertia, allowing the player to execute complex evasive maneuvers with some practice, or to plunge to his doom. Although Exerion indefinitively loops, it includes four types of levels (mountains, Clouds, City and Pyramids), each consisting of several enemy waves. Every fifth stage is a bonus area where the player takes down as many alien ships as possible in order to no only boost his score, but also to increase his rapid shot charge.

		<name>Express Raider (US set 1) </name>
		<desc>The wild west-themed Express Raider is separated into two different game types; a sideways scrolling fighting sequence and a shooting sequence. The player controls a train robber, or 'Express Raider', and must try to steal the bags of money from the moving locomotives.

During the fighting sequence, the Raider must fight the bank teller, hit the coyotes and then jump onto the train before it speeds away. Once on the train, he must fight his way past other enemies and avoid various projectiles, such as bottles, bullets and shovels full of coal. Players must be careful to duck under the low signs that come along as the train is travelling. Also, once a train carriage is clear of enemies, a bomb will appear between the current carriage and the next; players must quickly jump over to the next carriage before the bomb goes off, otherwise the Raider will fall from the train and a life is lost. If the Express Raider manages to reach the train engine, the loot will be captured and the game will then move on to the shooting sequence.

In the shooting sequence, the Express Raider rides a horse and must shoot at the enemies that appear from the windows of a train carriage. They will shoot back at the player and throw various objects. Players can hit the DUCK button to avoid the enemy attacks. A woman will appear at regular intervals offering the player a bag of money, if the player shoots the woman, a life is lost. After the shooting sequence has been completed, the game will start over again with an increased level of difficulty.

		<desc>A wholly abstract approach to the shoot-em-up genre in which one or two players take control of a disembodied, digitized human hand and must kill the swarms of insects that have infested a street of houses.

Exterminator is set in a street of houses and players must move from room to room in each property, clearing each one of the infestation, before moving onto the next house. Each player can initially only grab or 'thump' enemies (the latter for ground-based, crawling insects), but a number of power-ups, such as bug spray and somewhat bizarrely, a laser firing finger can be collected to make progress a little easier.

This game used an advanced (proprietary), compression algorithm to hold nearly 3700 questions in a tiny amount of EPROM space (roughly 128K, which was still a huge amount of storage in 1983, which was why this game was so expensive). Exidy also sold several EPROM replacement kits that provided new questions, but they sold very poorly, and are nearly impossible to find today.

		<desc>Final Fight is a side scrolling beat'm up and is the conversion by Capcom of their own arcade game originally released in 1989. The game features two playable characters - the heavy built but slow former champion wrestler Mike Haggar and the more agile and fast martial art expert Joe Cody. Here is the first difference that would strike players used to the arcade game - the third character from the original game, Guy, is nowhere to be seen. The Mad Gears gang has taken over Metro city and has kidnapped the daughter of the newly elected mayor, Mike Haggar. Jessica also happens to be Cody's girlfriend and our two heroes must fight their way through the city, beat-up dozens and dozens of vile gang members and finally take down the evil Belger, their murderous leader. Levels are built around locked-in sections, in which all opponents must be defeated to continue. The game also includes several bonus stages such as a fun car-breaking exercise with an iron pipe. Each fighter can use simple fighting moves such as punches, jumps and pressing punch rapidly triggers powerful combos. They can also grab and throw, or hold on and hit their enemies. Finally, each fighter comes with a special attack when punch and jump are pressed simultaneously - this move drains some of their health energy but allows them to safely escape desperate situations. This Super Famicom port is a cut-down version of the original arcade game, the two players mode is gone as well as the fourth factory/Industrial stage.

		<desc>Fire One! was a player-versus-player or player-versus-computer submarine showdown.

The primary objective of the game is to find and destroy the enemy's submarine, while avoiding the enemy's torpedoes. Through your virtual periscope you are free to launch one of your 8 torpedoes to take out any of the enemy's various ships for extra points. It takes some time to reload each torpedo tube, so you must be judicious in how you plan your attacks.

In addition to being able to control the left/right rotation of your periscope, the game also features a submerge button which you can use to temporarily hide from the enemy. Holding this button down keeps you hidden but also keeps you out of the action, allowing the enemy free reign over the seas.

		<desc>The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

		<name>Galaga '88 </name>
		<desc>Galaga '88 is a vertical shooter and conversion of Namco's arcade game of the same name originally released in 1987. Shoot the descending aliens! The game closely follows the gameplay mechanics introduced by Galaga and Galaxian, although it adds its own twists to the classic formula. It introduces a myriad of new and wacky enemies - some comically inflate as they get hit, some combine into larger foes whereas others explode and release swarms of all kind of tiny creatures. Every few levels, the player enters a bonus stage where formations of dancing aliens must be destroyed for points, and some levels even switch to vertical scrolling phases interspersed with a few boss battles. Although the game only features seven large areas (all divided into 25 sub-stages), the player can travel through different dimensions and technically access new and unique levels (two blue warp-pods must be collected in each area in order to jump to a higher dimension, giving the game a total of 22 areas). Finally, as in the original Galaga, some enemies can capture the player's ship with their tractor beams, and successfully freeing the captured ship doubles the player's firepower - the operation can be performed twice for the ultimate and powerful triple-ship! Interestingly, Galaga'88 allows the player to directly start the game with a double-ship (at the cost of one life).

		<name>Galaga (Namco rev. B) </name>
		<desc>Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called "Galagans". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. 

Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. 

The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it is destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. 

As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. 

Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values, as dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting. Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). 

The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in one row of four), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in two rows of eight, directly below the Boss Galaga), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in two rows of ten, directly below the Butterflies). 

In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in most of the later stages. 

From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green 'Spy Ships' from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. 

Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of eight Galagans is destroyed, bonus points are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10,000 points. 

Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are : 
1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. 
2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each.

		<desc>The general gameplay formula is the same as it was for both "Galaxian" and "Galaga", with the player controlling a spaceship that moves along the bottom of the screen and fires up at the enemy formations at the top of the screen. Movement is not confined to left and right, however, as players can also move anywhere in the bottom half of the screen.

The insectoid enemies fire down upon the player's ship, and both individual and groups of enemies will break away from the armada to make attack runs on the player. Most of the Galagans can be killed with a single shot, and shooting specific enemies will earn the player a tractor beam. This gives them the ability to capture one or more enemy ships; these prisoner ships will then sit alongside the player's ship and add to its firepower.

Every few levels, players will enter a 'Challenging Stage', where formations of enemy ships will fly in and out of the screen. Players must shoot them as many times as possible to try and spell out a word.

		<desc>Armed Police Unit Gallop is a futuristic shoot-em-up from the creators of "R*Type" in which the player takes on the role of a futuristic policeman who must destroy criminal controlled ships. 

As with most Irem shoot-em-ups, Gallop's weapons system is superb. As well as being equipped with the standard front-firing gun and ground targeting missiles (both of which can be upgraded with the retrieval of power-ups), the player's ship is armed with a homing laser that, when activated, emits a constant laser stream towards whatever enemies and bonus capsules are on screen. The laser has an 'Overheat' meter that depletes while the laser is in use. Once the meter is emptied the laser will stop working. The meter gradually refills allowing the player to continue using the laser.

		<desc>Gals Panic! is a "Qix"-style adult puzzle game.  The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.

To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette.  Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar.  If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated.

After every round there is a roulette game where the player can earn rewards or penalties that will take effect in the following round.

After winning three rounds against a girl, the graphic becomes a photographic image of that girl.

		<name>Golden Axe (set 6, US, 8751 317-123A) </name>
		<desc>Golden Axe is a side scrolling beat'em up by Telenet and conversion of Sega's popular arcade game. The evil lord Death Adder has come to threaten the peaceful land of Yuria. He now holds the king and his daughter captive in his castle, as well as the legendary Golden Axe which he intends to destroy if the people of Yuria don't crown him as the ruler of the country. Three warriors (also on a promise of personal revenge) set out on a long journey to defeat Death Adder and his motley army of mercenaries and undead monsters. Each fighter comes with a signature weapon and fighting techniques: Ax Battler is a muscular barbarian wielding a two-handed heavy sword, Tyris Flare is the only female of the group and carries a long-sword and Gilius Thunderhead is a dwarf armed with a sleek double axe. Each hero can also summon elementals to the party's aid - Ax posses the powers of the Earth, Tyris the powers of the Fire and Gilius the powers of the Lightning - and the more magic potions they collect and use, the more destructive the magic spells become. Another unique twist of Golden Axe is the ability given to the players to ride beasts, as long as their original owner can adequately be knocked off their ride first. All the rideable beasts come with special attacks, some use simple tail whips whereas others can breathe jets of fire. Golden Axe consists of eight stages but is single-player only.

		<name>Gorf </name>
		<desc>The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic "Space Invaders" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers five distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows : 

* Mission 1 - Astro Battles : The first mission is more or less a straight clone of "Space Invaders", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic forcefield, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The forcefield also works in BOTH directions, and therefore must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders. 

* Mission 2 - Laser Attack : The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to divebomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies. 

* Mission 3 - Galaxians : This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually divebomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians. 

* Mission 4 - Space Warp : A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies. 

* Mission 5, Flag Ship : The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own forcefield, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor. 

Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.

To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders. 

* Mission 2 - Laser Attack : The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to divebomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies. 

* Mission 3 - Galaxians : This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually divebomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians. 

* Mission 4 - Space Warp : A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies. 

* Mission 5, Flag Ship : The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own forcefield, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor. 

Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.

		<name>Gradius II - GOFER no Yabou (Japan New Ver.) </name>
		<desc>Gradius II is an horizontal shooter by Konami and conversion of their hit arcade game originally release in 1988. The Bacterion Empire has risen from its own ashes and is once more spreading doom and destruction throughout the universe. Led by the evil Gofer, the alien invasion now hits full swing and must be immediately stopped. The Vic Viper is back in service and ready to take on the upcoming threat. Gradius II retains the power-meter originally used in Gradius - the player collects power-pods left behind by orange enemies and moves onto the next available power-up from the meter. Upgrades range from Speed Up, Missiles, Double Shots, Multiples, Lasers and Shield. Unlike Gradius, this sequel offers four different power-meter configurations (available at the beginning of the game) which feature new weapons to choose from, such as the Tail Gun, Spread Bombs, Photo Torpedoes, Ripple Lasers and so forth. It also adds its own twist to the power system though, and some weapons can be activated twice for additional power - for instance, Missiles and Doubles can receive one upgrade each and Multiples can rotate around the Vic Viper for a short amount of time. Gradius II consists of seven stages and features an alternating two-player mode.

		<desc>Your task is to break Gravitar's hold on the 12 solar systems under his power. You can do this by destroying all bunkers on every planet or by setting off the reactor in the alien reactor base.

Each solar system consists of a killer sun, an alien reactor base, and three or four blockaded planets - each housing fuel deposits and enemy bunkers.

To move from one solar system to the next, you must either visit all the planets and destroy every enemy bunker or activate the reactor at the core of the alien reactor base and escape before it explodes.

When you complete your mission in the three solar systems of one galaxy, you are automatically transported to another galaxy, where your rescue mission will continue.

You start the game with 6 to 100 starships, depending on the game level, and with 10,000 fuel units. Your ship consumes fuel every time you use your thrust engines, activate your shields, or extend your tractor beam. A warning beep sounds when your fuel level goes below 2,000 units.

The game ends when you run out of fuel or lose all your spaceships. When you complete your mission, the game resets and your points continue to accumulate.

		<desc>Green Beret is a sideways-scrolling action/platform game set during the Cold War, in which a US Special Forces Marine must infiltrate a Russian military base to save four POW's from being executed by firing squad. 

Initially, the soldier is armed with only a combat knife, but by killing the certain enemy troops, players can obtain either a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. 

The Marine can jump or lie down to avoid the enemy bullets, as well as climbing ladders to avoid enemies and projectiles, as well as the flashing land mines that litter the levels. While it's possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage. 

The game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators. 

The game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

		<name>Gryzor (set 1) </name>
		<desc>In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien lifeform. Two years later in 2633, a terrorist organization of alien origin called Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

Gryzor is a hectic 1 or 2-player platform shoot-em-up featuring five stages. Three of the levels are standard side-scrolling platform levels, while the remaining 2 are enemy 'bases'; 3rd person into-the-screen stages in which players must run down series of heavily defended corridors to reach and destroy an end-of-level boss, before moving onto the next stage.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are :
* Machine gun [M] : Auto-fire.
* Spread gun [S] : Allows the player to fire five shots in an arc.
* Laser gun [L] : Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
* Fire Ball [F] : A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
* Rapid-fire [R] : Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon.
* Barrier [B] : Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game's 5 levels and bosses are as follows :
Stage 1 : Jungle  Defensive Wall  (horizontal scrolling)
Stage 2 : Base 01  Six turrets and alien eyeball  (3rd-person)
Stage 3 : Waterfall  Large Alien  (vertical scrolling)
Stage 4 : Base 02  Six turrets and alien head  (3rd-person)
Stage 5 : Snow Field/Energy Zone/Hangar/Alien Lair  Alien Heart  (horizontal scrolling)

The King's military is waiting for them, however, and the players must fight their way inland to reach and destroy the King's palace stronghold.

In this, the pseudo-sequel to SNK's own superb "Ikari Warriors" (released two years earlier), players must once again shoot their way through a number of vertically scrolling levels, all packed with large numbers of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and vehicles. Each level also contains a number of captured prisoners tied to wooden stakes, and these can be rescued for extra points. 

The players' weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition and additional ammo/grenades must be picked up along the way. A number of gun upgrades can also be found. At various points in the game, players can also enter unoccupied enemy tanks, which provide increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion occurs. Should the player be caught inside or near the tank when it explodes, a life is lost.

As with "Ikari Warriors", Guerrilla War features full 360 degree gameplay with attacking troops appearing from all directions. The players' on-screen counterparts are able to rotate themselves accordingly.

		<name>Gunforce - Battle Fire Engulfed Terror Island (World) </name>
		<desc>Gunforce is a side scrolling action shooter developed by Bits and published by Irem, and it is the conversion of the arcade game of the same name. In the year 2000, a mysterious alien organization and its growing army starts to invade others countries and to incapacitate their computer networks, thus compromising their ability to launch their own counteroffensives. As a last resort, the allied forces decide to dispatch an elite commando team called the 'GunForce'. Their mission is simple - take down the enemy command and communications centers and to ultimately destroy their massive sea fortress. Each soldier can shoot in eight different directions and is equipped with a basic rifle gun that they can later upgrade into more deadly weapons. The power-ups, usually left behind by defeated enemies or hidden inside crates, range from an Automatic Weapon, a Bazooka, a Flamethrower and a Laser. But each special weapon comes with a significant limitation - ammunition. Although the default gun grants the player unlimited ammo, all the others have a set amount of bullets. Furthermore, the soldiers can use a broad selection of vehicles scattered around each level (such as jeeps, turrets, helicopters or armored biped walkers) and devastate the enemy with far superior firepower. Additionally, Gunforce features a bit of a twist on the traditional Run'n Gun formula - enemies don't kill outright on contact (as they usually do in myriad of other action games), but only their bullets or vehicles do. Gunforce consists of five levels and also features a two simultaneous player mode.

		<name>Gyruss (Centuri) </name>
		<desc>Gyruss is a single player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. 

It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. 

Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.

Hang-On's handling and superb graphics were unlike anything seen before in the arcades and, like many Yu Suzuki games that followed, revolutionised the racing genre.

The 5 stages of 'Hang-On' are : 
Alps
Seaside
Grand Canyon
City Night

		<desc>20,000,000 instead of 10 (Note : This code appears briefly on screen after beating the game in Secret World mode).

* Alien Ball In Power Training Session : Go to the Power Training Session and hit all 50 volleyballs. Then, an alien-like ball with veins and teeth will be thrown at your head. If you miss, it will bite your face, but if you hit it, you'll receive an additional 10% increment, for a grand total of a 30% power increment.

* Moai Mask : Sometimes the referee will be wearing a mask of Moai, the stone head from Parodius and Cue Brick. I haven't confirmed what triggers this particular trick, but I think it could have something to do with the timer. -Maybe winning at 2 :22, 1 :11, or something like that-

* Alternate Credits Roll : Beat the game in New or Powerful World mode. When the credits roll, the names will remain the same but the titles will be different. 'Making of this game' is replaced by 'Staff of Conjax Pro'. Also, keep an eye out for a cameo by Pentarou the penguin from Parodius during either credits roll.

* The Mob Never Forgives : When you win the game and get the park scene, look carefully in the background to spot two hit men armed with UZIs and gunning down a poor guy. The girl next to him tries to run. Is this subliminal violence??

		<desc>Heavy Barrel is a scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players, in which an army of terrorists have seized control of a nuclear missile facility. Players must infiltrate the heavily defended base and shoot their way through seven levels before reaching the final enemy Boss confrontation.

As with SNK's "Ikari" series, Heavy Barrel allows players to rotate their on-screen character and fire and move in all directions. Additional weapons and power-ups can be found, as well as keys which are used to open locked weapon containers that litter the levels.

In addition to the standard in-game weapons, the "Heavy Barrel" gun of the game's title also features. This must be assembled by collecting six different components (found in locked weapon containers). Once completed, the Heavy Barrel gives the player incredible firepower and instantly destroys anything it hits (with the exception of end-of-level bosses, which take several hits), although the Heavy Barrel only lasts for a period of thirty seconds, as indicated by a depleting red bar displayed at the top of the screen.

Some enemy aircraft waves produce bonuses when shot down, such as weapon power-ups, point bonuses, and extra lives. Each stage begins and ends with an airport runway and every time the player lands on a runway at the completion of a stage, the amount of remaining player bombs are multiplied by 3000 points per bomb and added to the player's score. All bombs are replenished for the start of the next stage.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Learn to recognize cargo as it float in the water. Otherwise, you will not get paid. Without money, you cannot strengthen your craft. That means you will probably be creamed by enemy missiles.

* Get as much fuel as possible. Without it, you don't stand a chance.

* Know when to fly, and when to stay low. There are a few things in life more frustrating than missing all the money bags because you are in the wrong place at the wrong time.

* Shoot enemy craft whenever possible. The rewards are great.

		<name>I, Robot </name>
		<desc>I, Robot is a 3-D shoot-em-up in which the player controls the "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984"; a servant robot who has become self-aware and decided to rebel against the all-controlling Big Brother and his ever-watchful 'Evil Eyes'.

The game is set over a series of platform-based stages constructed from solid coloured blocks and to complete a stage, players must "eliminate the red zones". This is achieved by moving the robot over all of a stage's red surfaces, changing their colour to blue. The colour scheme - including target colour - changes every 26 levels, however. So while the target colour is red for the first 26 screens, it becomes yellow from Level 27, blue from Level 53 and magenta from Level 79.

In order to reach all of the platforms and surfaces, the Interface robot will need to jump. This must be carefully timed, however, as jumping is not allowed under Big Brother's strict regime and his Evil eye - sitting atop a pyramid at the back of the playfield - will open at regular intervals to watch over the interface robot. Should the eye be fully open - indicated by it turning red - when the robot is mid-jump, he will be spotted and destroyed, costing the player a life.

Once all of the coloured squares on a stage have been eliminated, the enemy's shield is destroyed and the Interface Robot will need to be guided to a final, previously inaccessible coloured square at the back of the playfield. The Evil Eye is then zapped and destroyed.

Some levels feature different background elements that affect gameplay, such as walls that must be shot and destroyed to reach coloured tiles, or indestructible moving columns that intermittently block access to coloured tiles, making timing difficult. There are also enemies to be shot or avoided, including birds, bombs and flying sharks.

Once the eye has been beaten, Interface Robot automatically jumps to the top of the pyramid and launches itself into space. A short inter-level "Space Wave" to the next stage follows. These stages feature polygonal objects hurling through space that must be either avoided or destroyed.

Every third level contains a red pyramid that must entered once all coloured squares are eliminated. Once inside, the Robot has one chance to collect as many bonus jewels as possible before destroying the Evil Eye. If the Robot is destroyed while inside the pyramid, he is immediately thrust back into space. The player must then battle through three more levels and destroy a further three Evil Eyes before getting another chance to collect any high scoring pyramid jewels.

After every fourth level, the Space Wave stage features a battle with Big Brother himself, shown as a huge, disembodied polygonal head. Big Brother constantly spits cone-shaped projectiles from his mouth and every single one of these must be shot or they will collide with and kill the player.

The head can be forced to rotate by repeatedly shooting the side of its face. If the head isn't facing the robot, danger is minimized since he won't fire his cone-shaped projectiles when facing away. Players must simply survive this encounter for about 20 seconds, after which Big Brother flies away and the next level begins.

I, Robot features 126 stages, with 26 unique level designs. After level 26, the designs repeat at a higher difficulty level and with an altered colour palette. The on-screen level counter is only two digits, so levels 100126 are displayed as 026 respectively. On passing level 126, the player gets thrown back to a random earlier level.

Once the game is underway, pressing the one-player Start button will incrementally zooms the game's camera closer in to the action, while the two-player Start button pulls it further back, offering new viewing angles of the playfield. Closer camera angles result in higher score multipliers, due to the increased difficulty of visibility. In later levels, enemies known as "Viewer Killers" directly attack the player rather than the robot, forcing players to either switch camera angles, or move the robot to scroll the camera away from the Viewer Killers

'I, Robot' was - in both technical and design terms - ahead of its time and the game featured many new and ground-breaking innovations that the games industry would later adopt. The most striking and obvious of these was the game's graphics. While 'I, Robot' wasn't the world's first three-dimensional game, it was the first to feature solid, filled-polygon graphics, as opposed to the wire-frame graphics adopted by earlier titles. The concept of players being able to switch viewpoints also appeared here first.

The final innovation was 'Doodle City'. Instead of playing the game, players could instead choose to use the game's colourful three-dimensional objects to draw pictures on the monitor screen. Doodle City lasts for three minutes per credit, although players can switch back to playing 'I, Robot' at any time. When switching back to the game, the number of lives the player has is dictated by how much time was spent on Doodle City, with one life taken away for every minute in the "Ungame" mode.

		<desc>SNK's answer to Capcom's 'Commando', released a year earlier, one or two players take on the role of a 'Rambo-esque' soldier as they fight on land and water to reach the village of Ikari. most of the action takes place on foot, although players will occasionally stumble across unoccupied enemy tanks which can be entered and driven. Standing between the players and their destination are a multitude of enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and static gun emplacements.

Each different enemy soldier-type is equipped with a different weapon, such as a semi-automatic machine gun, automatic machine gun, grenades, and super grenades. To assist the players in their struggle, a number of power-ups can be picked up, such as extended shot range and hand-grenades. As the players' munitions are depletable, additional ammo/grenades must to be picked up along the way. players can also enter tanks, which offer increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to leave the tank before the explosion takes place. Should the player be caught inside when the tank explodes, a life is lost.

Unlike Capcom's 'Commando', Ikari features 360 degree gameplay, as a result of this the home conversions could never hope to match the arcade machine's rotary joystick controls.

		<desc>Image Fight is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with an original premise. The game's first five stages are supposed to be a 'simulation' and serve as training to test the player's abilities. Player's will receive a penalty if their hit-ratio is too low.

Once players have proved themselves on the opening stages, they will progress to the game's last three stages, blasting off into space on a mission to destroy the alien vegetation surrounding the Moon's main computer. If the player fails in the mission, they must endure the dreaded 'Penalty Zone'. Features a high level of challenge, a wide variety of weapons and the ability to change speed.

If the player's ship is equipped with one or more red/blue extra guns, pushing both Action buttons simultaneously will sling the guns forward in a boomerang-like fashion. This is a powerful and destructive method and can be done an unlimited number of times.

Theme music and sound effects are from the movie of the same name. This is the first Atari System I game to use speech capability to talk to players.

Official world records for this game (for each difficulty and number of starting lives) are :
Hard (7 lives) : Cliff Reese with 1,993,530 points
Hard (3 lives) : Cliff Reese with 1,410,930 points
Med. (3 lives) : Cliff Reese with 945,070 points
Easy (3 lives) : Cliff Reese with 800,000 points

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

At the difficulty select screen, whip all the hanging skeletons and both snakes to receive a 5,000 point 'Completion Bonus'. Whipping all the gas cannisters in the mines stage gives a 'Pyro Bonus' and whipping every bone pile and snake in the altar stage also gives a bonus. On levels which feature pits of molten lava, whipping enemy guards until they fall in the lava will earn additional bonus points.

A 4th row has aliens that turn into bombs, blowing up everything around them to make your job somewhat easier.

		<name>Jack the Giantkiller (set 1) </name>
		<desc>This game plays a lot like "Donkey Kong" except that the controls are not quite as smooth. There are 5 screens to master if you want to help Jack in his mission. You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen 1 right to screen 4.
* The 1st screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).
* In the 2nd screen, Jack manuevers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.
* The 3rd screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.
* On the 4th screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.
* The 5th screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).

After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.

		<name>Joust (Solid Red label) </name>
		<desc>Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.

In the distance you see an enemy vulture appear on a creator pad. You ready your lance and prepare to do battle. As you draw close to the enemy Bounder, you rise above him and prepare to defeat him with a quick swooping attack. You sweep down from the sky and dismount the enemy rider with a powerful blow.

		<name>Joust 2 - Survival of the Fittest </name>
		<desc>On the planet of the floating cliffs, society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a Joust... where only the fittest survive! 

The legend of "Joust" continues in Joust 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of Joust 2's 35 different backgrounds. 

The object of Joust 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (joust), the Gladiator's lance must be higher. 

Defeating a Buzzard Enemy in a Joust causes release of an Egg. Eggs may be caught in the air or collected on landing areas for bonus points. Be Careful! Eggs falling into the Lava form into aggressive mutants, while uncollected Eggs hatch into dangerous warriors. 

Danger lurks everywhere! Giant Statues come to life; Bats fall out of crystals embedded in the rocks; Lava Trolls and Water Monsters eat unsuspecting bird-mounts; Lightning fills the air; and Unbeatable? Pterodactyls patrol the skies. A gigantic Knight presides on several waves. You, the Gladiator, must destroy him! Hitting all four of his red pins explodes the Knight and all his servants. 

Gold Egg Feature : A Gold Egg may randomly appear on any wave. Collecting the Gold Egg before it hatches opens a window of awards in the background. To collect an award, step on the red button above the window before a timer expires. Both players reap the benefits of the posted award, which may include bonuses of 1,000 to 10,000 points, 'super zapping' all enemies on the screen, or even receiving an extra life. 

Prepare thyself for War! 

Buy-In : Joust 2 is designed for action entertainment for one or two simultaneous players. Players who have started the game may continue where they left off by using the buy-in feature. When a player has used all of his lives, he will hear : "Wish to continue?" A 10-second timer appears in the players score area to allow the game to continue by using a Credit, or inserting a coin, before the player presses the Start button. 

Level Selection : At the beginning of a game, the player selects, via the Flap button, one of six different waves, corresponding to the player's skill level. Then, pressing the Start button begins the game. If the player wins the starting wave, he receives an award of points, approximating the scoring from preceding waves.

		<name>Joyful Road (Japan) </name>
		<desc>A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.

The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive.

		<name>Jr. Pac-Man </name>
		<desc>One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide. 

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life. 

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts. 

As with previous "Pac-Man" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in "Ms. Pac-Man". Jr. Pac-Man's story tells of the blossoming love between Jr. Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum. 

Act I - Jr. Meets Yum-Yum : Jr. Pac-Man steps outside his home to play. He spots Yum-Yum beyond the fence in his yard and goes outside to meet her. Blinky, hiding in the shadows, comes out from hiding to catch Jr. However Ms. Pac-Man, keeping a watchful eye over her child, sees the commotion from her window and runs out to the yard to eat a Power Pill and chase both ghosts away while Jr. returns to the safety of home. This intermission is played after Round 1. 

Act II - The Gift : It seems that Jr. can't get the enchanting young ghost out of his mind, so he proceeds to bring a balloon to her as a gift the next day. Excited to see her, he meets her on a bridge and hands her the balloon, when we catch a glimpse of Blinky lurking behind a bush. This intermission is played after Round 3. 

Act III - They Escape : Blinky moves from one bush to the another, startling Yum-Yum into releasing the balloon. Blinky attempts to capture Jr. once and for all, but once again, Ms. Pac-Man comes to the rescue. Blinky chases her off to the left, while Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum escape to the right. Once alone, they gaze in to each other's eyes and fall in love, with hearts appearing all around them. This intermission is played after Rounds 5, 7, and 9.

		<name>Jungle King (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Jungle King is a jungle adventure game where players take on the role of Jungle King, a Tarzan-like jungle man, who is going in search of his Jungle Princess, who has been kidnapped by a pair of barbaric cannibals. 

Jungle King has four stages, each with its own unique scenarios, so each stage could be considered a separate game in its own right. 

It is noticable that this game scrolls from right to left, while the vast majority of scrollers go from left to right, although most people probably wouldn't even notice that. 

Jungle King's gameplay is very similar to that of Activision's "Pitfall", a classic arcade game released on many home computer and console formats of the time. 

The game's stages are as follows : 
* The first stage, which may have been the best stage in the game, is set in a forest with a series of swinging vines. Players must use the JUMP button to move from right to left across the vines, while avoiding the monkeys that can send Jungle King falling to the ground. This level is easy to master, but players must time their jumps carefully to make it to the next vine. 
* The second stage is set under a jungle river. Players must guide Jungle King through a river infestest with alligators and crocodiles. This stage features a 'breath meter' that must be carefully watched to avoid drowning (players simply swim up to the surface to get more air). Jungle King is armed with a knife with which he can stab the crocs and gators, but this can only be done when their mouths are not fully open. 
* The third stage is an avalanche with boulders rolling down a hill. The player simply uses the joystick to control Jungle King's climbing speed up the hill, and the JUMP button to leap over rolling boulders until they reach the end of the stage. 
* The fourth and final stage has the player guiding Jungle King through a cannibal village. Jungle King must jump over the cannibals while their spears are down, and eventually make his way towards his Jungle Princess, who is being lowered into a pot to be boiled for supper. 

On completion of the game, players are rewarded with a short 'I Love You' ending, and then the game begins again with increased difficulty.

		<name>Kaitei Daisensou (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Kaitei Daisensou is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two-players. Each player takes control of a submarine and must shoot their way through the game's six levels as they are attacked from both beneath the water in which the submarine moves (by enemy subs, gun emplacements, mines etc.), as well from above the water-line, by boats, jet fighters and helicopters. Numerous power-ups can be collected to boost the sub's meagre fire-power. 

This is a superb game, created by the ame team behind the legendary "R*Type" series. The superbly-rendered graphics are very similar in style to Irem's "R*Type Leo", released a year earlier. Kaitei Daisensou would prove to be Irem's last 'traditional' arcade shoot'em up, although two further R*Type sequels were released for home consoles (see R*Type Series section for more info).

		<desc>Kiki Kaikai is a top-down action game by Taito and conversion of their own arcade game originally released back in 1986. The protagonist of the game is a cute little girl called Sayo and her duty is to rescue her family members from the Dark World. Each stage is populated by creatures borrowed from Japanese mythology and folklore and Sayo must find the key hidden someplace in the area and guarded by a vicious boss. But Sayo Chan is not empty-handed and she has two weapons at her disposal - her magic duster-wand is quite effective in close combat but her long range magic cards are definitely the meat of the game. Flying ghosts, skeletons and zombies won't stand a chance against fully-powered magic cards and Sayo can upgrade them in many ways. Powerful magic balls can also be collected along the way and they can destroy everything on screen in the blink of an eye (press I and II simultaneously to release them). Finally, the game is far from linear and later stages offer different routes.

		<name>Kyohkoh-Toppa (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Kyohkoh-Toppa is a horizontally scrolling shoot'em up in which the player drives an armoured car, equipped with a front-mounted gun and super jump capability. The aim of the game is to fight through five enemy-controlled zones to retrieve a stolen top-secret fighter plane, the PK430.

The game's levels force-scroll from right to left, although the vehicle's speed - and rate of scrolling - can be slowed down and speeded up to some degree. As well as a forward-firing gun, the car can be made to jump huge distances. This is necessary to avoid background obstacles such as rock falls and broken bridges. It can also be used to avoid incoming enemy fire and vehicles. Land mines also litter the levels and need to be shot or avoided.

Kyohkoh-Toppa consists of five stages: Mountain, Bridge, Prairie, City and Airfield.

Collect letters to spell EXTRA for a bonus life (just like in "Mr. Do!"), and SPECIAL for an extra credit. The maze has rotating doors which are just enough to give the game a slightly different feel than the Pac-Man series.

		<name>Lazer Command </name>
		<desc>You have an overhead view of a maze with two sides, the sides mirror each other. The left side of the screen is yellow, and the right side is green. On each side are fifteen tanks. The object is to blow up all of the opposing players tanks (or as many as you can before the timer runs out). You can only control one tank at a time, you can move them around and blast your opponents tanks (getting the active one is usually a good idea). When you get blasted, your tank vanishes, and you must move a little blip over to another tank to resume play (this blip is invisible unless it is against a wall). You can also leave your tank and head for another one by pressing the second button. This is just a great strategic title, it holds up even today. It is really worth playing if you like that sort of thing. Just be aware that this is a two player only title, so you will need a friend to play against.

		<name>League Bowling (NGM-019)(NGH-019) </name>
		<desc>A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.

The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.

The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.

		<name>Lost Tomb (easy) </name>
		<desc>A shoot-em-up set in an ancient, South American pyramid, in which the player must explore a large number of single rooms in the search for treasure. Each room is filled with enemy creatures that must be killed or avoided. The player is equipped with a limited amount of whips and must collect as many items of treasure as possible.

The player is presented with options throughout the game, depending upon which rooms they wish to enter. Once a path is chosen, players must pick up treasures, kill all the monsters in their way, find the key and exit the room as fast as they can; avoiding the potential of setting off an earthquake. Upon exiting a level, the player is presented with a hallway which shows a number of doorways allowing access to any one of several different rooms. This allows players to pick their own route through the game, but the decision which room to tackle next must be taken quickly as players must reach their chosen room quickly or risk being attacked by a flock of screeching birds.

The player's character is armed with an eight-way firing gun (in a similar fashion to Williams' 1982 classic, "Robotron"). In addition to the gun, the player is also equipped with three whips, which can be used to either kill attacking creatures or to knock down any walls that bar the player's progress. Players are given the opportunity to purchase additional whips at the interludes between levels; this is done by inserting an extra credit into the arcade machine and pressing the relevant button.

Treasure must be constantly collected in order to stay alive.

Licensed to Sega for Japan market.

Atari's first vector game. "Lunar Lander", was inspired by "Moonlander", a game written by Jack Burness in 1973 as a demo for the DEC GT40 vector graphics terminal (based on a PDP-11/05 CPU). This game used a light pen to control thrust and rotation.

If the player landed at exactly the right spot, a McDonalds appeared. The astronaut would leave the lander and walk over to the McDonalds and order a Big Mac to go, before walking back to the Lander and taking off again. If players crashed directly into the McDonalds, the game displayed a message reading 'You clod. You've destroyed the only McDonald's on the Moon.' After a short run of Lunar Lander machines were manufactured, production was shifted over to "Asteroids" and the first few hundred "Asteroids" machines were housed in Lunar Lander cabinets. Atari donated a gold edition version of the coin-operated video game to the Discovery Center of Science &amp; Technology in Syracuse, New York.

On 17 June 1980, Atari's "Asteroids" and "Lunar Lander" were the first two video games to ever be registered in the Copyright Office.

David Nelson holds the officially recognized world record for this game (certified via Twin Galaxies) with 1525 points. This was achieved using a single credit and 750 units of fuel which are the default settings for this game.

A Lunar Lander units appears in the 1984 movie 'The Philadelphia Experiment'.

		<name>M.I.A. - Missing in Action (Japan) </name>
		<desc>M.I.A. is a direct sequel to 1985's 'Green Beret' and, like it's predecessor, is a horizontally scrolling jump and shoot game for one or two players. Special forces soldiers must penetrate several enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound. 

Upon reaching the compound, the player must infiltrate and rescue the POWs held there, before escorting them safely through a final enemy-packed level to the rescue helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Unlike 'Green Beret', the two-player game in M.I.A. sees both players fighting side-by-side, instead of the alternate approach of the original game. 

The game consists of six stages; 

* War-torn battlefield 
* Airstrip 
* Jungle 
* Rail Yard 
* PoW Base 
* Escort the PoW's to the Helicopter 

The first four stages are presented in random order and may also be "mirrored", so players battle right-to-left instead of left-to-right. This vastly increases variety to the game and adds replay value. The PoW and helicopter stages are always the last two stages. At the end of each level, the players must fight off a flurry of enemy troops and destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. 

As with 'Green Beret', players start each level carrying only a combat knife. Specific enemy troops carry weapons which are dropped when the soldier is killed and can be picked up by the players. The weapons are always carried by soldiers wearing red uniforms, and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower or a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots. 

After rescuing the PoW's on the sixth stage, players must escort as many of the escapees as possible to a waiting helicopter, and must get at least one PoW safely aboard the chopper to complete the mission and start a new set of stages.

Destroying all of the planets in a round before the they reach their full scale will see the player awarded with bonus points. Fully-grown planets are orbited by a number of small moons, which, if destroyed, cause the planet to go 'mad' - turning red and making a beeline for the player's ship. The game also includes bonus rounds in which stranded astronauts can be rescued for additional points.

		<name>Magic Sword: Heroic Fantasy (Japan 900623) </name>
		<desc>The land has been cast in darkness by Drokmar, who has been corrupted by the Black Orb; an artefact that promises immortality to anyone who comes under the influence of the orb's powerful sorcery. Two warriors set out to fight their way through fifty levels of platform beat-em-up, in order to destroy the orb - which lies at the top of the Dragon Tower - and free their lands.

Treasure chests litter the levels which, when smashed open, release treasure items, magic power-ups, keys, food and weapons. As players fight their way through the levels, they will come across a number of trapped prisoners. As long as the heroes are carrying keys, prisoners can be released who will then fight alongside the players, with each prisoner possessing their own unique attacks. Weapons and power-ups can be picked up to aid players in their quest and food can be found and eaten to increase player health.

As the players ascend the tower, they will be granted new magical weapons after each boss they defeat. The player's weapons are affected by a 'magic bar' that charges over time. When fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by pressing the Attack and Jump buttons at once, but costs health.

There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.

		<name>Majestic Twelve - The Space Invaders Part IV (Japan) </name>
		<desc>The third sequel to Taito's seminal "Space Invaders", Majestic Twelve leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco's "Galaxian" - ensure that Majestic 12 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.

The original game's flying saucer still makes an appearance, but instead of merely awarding bonus points when shot - as in the original game - it now drops a power-up pod for the player to retrieve. Power-ups include shield, faster shots, a laser (activated with the second button) and a giant butterfly, which freezes the invaders for a limited time.

One of the game's most memorable features was the 'Cattle Mutilation' bonus screen, in which the player must protect a heard of cattle from a number of fast-moving saucers, intent on stealing the animals. If a cow is snatched; the player must shoot the relevant saucer to free it; being careful not to actually shoot the cow itself. The '91 incarnation also introduced 'bosses' to the series for the first time; giant, screen-filling aliens that required several shots to kill.

Another major difference to the previous games in the series is that if an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will simply lose a ship (in the original, the game would end once an alien had landed). Also, the player's ship now comes equipped with a shield that can withstand several hits. The shield's strength is depleted every time it takes a direct hit from one of the invaders, and too many hits will result in the shield disappearing altogether. A direct hit on an un-shielded ship will result in the loss of a player life.

Mark Cerny came in the middle of the design, adding one of the space waves (the flying fish) and the last four base ship mazes. He also added some objects to the mazes (such as the gun and floating boots) and helped clean up old items that never got shipped.

The original name for the game was "Tollian Web", from the Star Trek episode The Tholian Web - an episode that also provided the inspiration for the unreleased "Ms. Gorf". Later titles included "Alpha One" and "Major Rex Havoc" (which was dropped when Atari discovered an underground comic with a similar name).

Ettore Ciaffi holds the official record for this game with 1,940,078 points.

A hack of this game is called "Major Havoc Return to Vax".

A Major Havoc unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.

Marble Madness was the first game to feature true stereo sound; it was the first game to truly capitalise on what in-game music could offer the player, with each level having its own distinctive, and suspense building soundtrack. Marble Madness was also one of the few games of the time to have a definite goal, in that the game ends when all levels are completed.

The race names are :
1. Practice
2. Beginner
3. Intermediate
4. Aerial
5. Silly
6. Ultimate

Default highscore table (TROUBLEMAKERS) :
#1 C R 14,500
#2 UFO 14,000
#3 GJL 13,500
#4 SKP 13,000
#5 PCT 12,500
#6 PTR 12,000
#7 JDH 11,500
#8 DAT 11,000
#9 JFS 10,500
#10 DAR 10,000

Stan Szczepanski holds the official record for this game with 187,880 points.

A sequel to this classic game, entitled "Marble Madness 2 - Marble Man" was fully developed and a very small number of cabinets were built, but unfortunately the game was never released. Unlike the first game's superb trackball control, 'Marble Man' was controlled via a joystick.

		<name>Megatack </name>
		<desc>SINGLE PLAYER GAME

The game-play sequence in MEGATACK consists of 4 or 5 turns (operator selectable) each of which lasts as long as the player can skilfully maneuver his spacepod to avoid destruction. When he loses a spacepod, the GIP message reappears, accompanied by the GIP sound, and displays the number of spacepods left. After the last spacepod is destroyed, the game-over sound is heard and the game-over message is displayed.

Assuming a (4) pod game, play begins with player-scores (00000) and at the top and the (3) best scores displayed across the bottom Eight (8) monsters appear in the upper portion of the screen and move towards the bottom, while dropping their bombs. The player uses his joystick control to move his spacepod across the bottom of the screen. The spacepod will start with the number (4) in the center and the number will decrease each time a spacepod is destroyed so that the number (1) will be in the center on the last round.

As the spacepod is moved across the bottom of the screen the player fires his laser energy-beams towards the left, right, and straight-up accompanied by an echoing laser sound effect. The laser beams have unlimited range, covering the entire play-field, and each spacepod has an unlimited number of shots. The (3) laser beams are fired simultaneously. Each fire-button must be released and pressed again to fire a second shot. Also, there is a slight "reload" delay so that beams cannot-be fired too rapidly.

Whenever a laser beam strikes a monster or a bomb, it explodes with a visual flash and an audio blast. If a monster is blasted, the player is awarded a 'kill' and his score is increased by the appropriate score (per the scoring menu when a bomb is blasted, no points are scored.  

When a spacepod is hit by a bomb, it explodes with a growing flash and a reverberating blast. When the spacepod gets too close to a monster, the monster jumps up and sporadically devours it while growling and burping, if a monster reaches the bottom, it bounces across the bottom in an attempt to devour the spacepod.

When all the monsters in a given round have been destroyed the screen will turn into a starfield, and small space rings will appear, which if not shot at, hit, and destroyed will grow in size. If any one (1) ring is allowed to reach a predetermined size, it will de-activate the spacepods laser gun, which during these rounds only fires straight up, lift the spacepod off the bottom of the screen, absorb it and then disappear (shrinking in size), thus ending the round. The next round begins with the next wave of monsters. This starfield round occurs between every wave of monsters, and if the player is successful in destroying all the rings the next wave of monsters will then appear.

When the spacepod is finally destroyed either by being absorbed, hit by a bomb or devoured by a monster the round is over and the video image returns to the GIP display flashing player (1) up and displaying the remaining spacepods the screen then goes black again and this time the pod with the number (3) in the center appears at the bottom of the screen and play continues as before.

During play there are always (8) monsters (max) on the screen, however the monsters attack in waves of 25, after each multiple of 25 kills the starfield or space ring round will appear with each ring worth the same score as the monsters were worth in the previous screen display. The monsters that reappear after each space ring round are a new shape, and color and score more points, and drop a different color bomb, any monsters left at the end of a round will reappear at the beginning of the next round. At the beginning of the game the action is rather moderate to allow new players an opportunity to develop a 'feel' for the game. In each succeeding wave of monsters, the bombs begin to fall at an increased rate and the monsters motions are increased.

All of these features combine to make MEGATACK satisfying for the novice, challenging for the expert, and profitable for the operator.

TWO-PLAYER MODE

The play of MEGATACK in a two-player game is identical to single-play with the players alternating turns. On the Upright Version, the players use one common set of controls. On the cocktail version there are two sets of controls on opposite sides of the table. The computer activates control alternately between player 1 and 2 and flip-flops the screen image so that it is oriented to the player in control.

The GIP message, which appears after each turn, clearly indicates which player is up by flashing it in the player's color. This also allows time for the players to position themselves at the controls, but is brief enough to avoid unnecessary "dead-time". The use of two different player-colors eliminates any confusion as to which player is in control.

		<desc>A single player runs through a number of futuristically-themed levels, avoiding obstacles - Coca-Cola cans, barriers, green floor tiles (which slow the player's progress), holes etc. - and attempt to reach the finish line before the tight time limit expires. Progress is aided by springboards - which allow the player to jump over obstacles - and a skateboard, which is unaffected by the green tiles that otherwise slow the player's progress. Bonus points can be earned by kicking the static drinks cans that can be found throughout each level.

		<desc>One or two players take on the role of two commando brothers whose entire family has been kidnapped and must be rescued. The game's eight large, eight-way scrolling levels are made up of platforms, ledges and ladders; each populated both with enemy soldiers and with intricate, imaginatively designed enemy machinery.

In a gameplay mechanic first introduced in SNK's 'Ikari Warriors', players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to target and fire in all directions.

Some enemies, when killed, will drop a red key; collecting these keys allows players to upgrade their weapons at the shop that awaits at the end of each level. A maximum of six keys can be carried at any one time.

		<desc>Mizubaku Daibouken is a colorful platform game by Taito, conversion of their own arcade game originally release in 1990. The protagonist of the game is a cute platypus named Hipopo on a mission to rescue his beloved girl friend and the rest of the platypus village from the claws of an evil fire demon. To help him in his task, our friend is given the power to throw water-bubbles to stun his enemies - once immobilized, Hipopo can kick them to oblivion for good. The power is however limited and our friend is condemned to wait to charge-up large bubbles. The player must guide our hero towards the Demon's hideout in order to free his friends - each zone is made out of several stages. Successfully completing a zone gets Hipopo to affront a boss but also allows him to choose his next route - later stages have several exists and secret warp doors which lead to different parts of the game's world. Finally, Hipopo can collect various special items such as speed-up, rapid-fire, large-bubbles, shield and so forth. Special food items can also be released by killing several enemies at once and blasting multiple combo-chains !

DRACULA'S HOUSE
The player-hero of the game is LITTLE RED, a wily, red-headed boy who chases Dracula throughout his five-story haunted house. Up and down staircases and through Warp Doors leading to secret passageways, Little Red zaps defending bats while attempting to light candles in certain rooms. When a candle is lit a Magic Sword is energized with mystical powers. Little Red must touch the flashing Magic Sword to gain SuperZap power... only a SuperZap will defeat the sly Dracula.

FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE
Little Red enters the eerie castle of the hulking Frankenstein. He pursues Frankenstein around his six-story castle while avoiding the fierce Wolfmen.  The tricky Wolfmen can be zapped, but be careful, they can duck under the zap and attack Little Red. Fewer candles are now available to be lit. Warp doors to secret passageways can be used only when they flash. Special jump-down zones allow Little Red to jump down several levels at once, eliminating any Wolfmen in the way as he descends, but Frankenstein can only be defeated with a SuperZap.

CHAMELEON MAN'S GRAVEYARD
The greatest challenge yet... to dispatch the sneaky Chameleon Man and his horde of Spiders.  Entering the spooky graveyard, Little Red finds that only one candle is available for lighting which is found in a crypt guarded by giant Spiders. Chameleon Man changes his color to match that of the background and thus becomes invisible. Little Red must pass over one of the Color-Change Spots to change the background color making Chameleon Man visible again. Chameleon Man can do away with Little Red with a flick of his long tongue. Chameleon Man can only be done in with a SuperZap.

		<name>Moon Cresta (bootleg set 1) </name>
		<desc>MOON CRESTA is a 1 or 2-player game in which players may compete for highest score against the game computer. Each time a player is hit by an alien, the game switches to his opponent's sequence.

The object is to destroy as many of the descending aliens as possible. To accomplish this the player is given a three stage multi-fire Warship. He begins with the first stage, firing a single laser at the enemy. If he is successful in eliminating the first 4 sets of aliens, he is given an opportunity to dock his first stage onto the second within a specific time limit (the sooner he unites the stages, the higher is his awarded score).

Once docked, the stages combine their firing power, so the first (1 laser) adds to the second (2 lasers) giving the player a total of 3 usable lasers as the game continues.

The player then must face 2 more sets of aliens and a shower of meteors, after which he has a chance to dock again, this time uniting with the third stage for a combined fire power of five lasers. If he is able to defeat the last two sets of aliens intact, the entire sequence begins again. The game continues with increasing difficulty until the entire warship is destroyed. When the warship is hit the player continues with whatever stages remain. If his score reaches 30,000 he is awarded a free game and his score continues to accumulate.

		<desc>Mortal Kombat is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different fighters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. 

Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a round a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.

		<name>Mortal Kombat II (rev L1.4) </name>
		<desc>Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. 

As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. 

Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. 

Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). 

Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.

		<name>Mr. Do! (bugfixed) </name>
		<desc>Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.

Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.

Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.

After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.

A level can be completed any one of several different ways : either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).

		<name>Mr. Do's Castle (set 1) </name>
		<desc>For the second game in the Mr. Do! series, the clown finds himself in a traditional platforms and ladders game. Each level is made up of six floors (seven including the castle's ramparts) and all are joined by a number of inter-connecting ladders. The ladders come in two different varieties: vertical ladders, which are fixed and cannot be moved; and diagonal ladders, which can be pushed left or right from the top of the ladder. This allows Mr. Do to reach other areas of the level and is sometimes necessary to redirect the path of any pursuing enemies. 

The enemies in Mr. Do's Castle come in the form of unicorns, and as with the enemies of the first game, they will hunt down and try to kill Mr. Do. Replacing the 'Powerball' weapon of the original game, Mr. Do is now armed with a mallet. This can be used to temporarily stun the unicorns and buy Mr. Do some time to escape; but its primary function is to knock out the floor blocks that form each level's platforms.

Most blocks are marked with a cherry and collecting all of these will complete the level (on later revisions only, see Updates below). A level can also be completed by killing all of the unicorns. This is achieved by using the mallet to remove blocks and knock holes in the platforms. The unicorns will fall into any holes that the player has created; some simply fall through to the platform below, whereas others are trapped. Trapped unicorns can be hit with Mr. Do's mallet and knocked to a lower platform - useful for buying a few extra seconds for the player. If left alone, however, the unicorns will climb out, filling the hole in behind them, and transform into much nastier enemies. These new enemies cannot be stunned with the mallet and must be killed by dropping blocks onto them from the platform above.

Some sections of a platform have two 'skull' blocks at either end of them, with normal blocks in between. When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all of the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards. This is highly effective in killing several enemies at once.

Each level also has three 'key' blocks. If Mr. Do knocks out all three key blocks, a large door opens at the top of the screen to reveal a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into 'Alphamonsters'. The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor block onto them from above. When Mr. Do kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded.

		<name>Mr. Do's Wild Ride </name>
		<desc>Mr Do's third arcade outing is another platform game, following on from the superb "Mr. Do's Castle", released a year earlier. The synonymous Mr. Do! cherries are present and correct, but are not used in the same way as in other games in the series. In both "Mr Do!" and "Mr. Do's Castle", collecting all of the cherries available was a way of completing a level. In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the 'prize' awarded upon reaching the level's goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.

The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong", with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn't have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.

Each of the game's six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn't feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.

The levels are :
Level 1, Roller Coaster. 
Level 2, Pirate Ship. 
Level 3, Three Elevators. 
Level 4, Castle on Screen. 
Level 5, Multiple Columns. 
Level 6, Six Rings.

After level six the levels are repeated.

		<name>Mr. HELI no Daibouken </name>
		<desc>Mr Heli no Daib?ken is the conversion of Irem's shooter originally released in the arcades in 1987. It features a cute little orange helicopter with tiny feet. Thanks to these, Mr Heli can fly around the screen and also walk on the ground. All of this plays an important role in the game's mechanics - He can shoot straight in front of him (either left or right), or shoot missiles above him. However, when on the ground, the same action button instead drops bombs. The power-up system is very unusual and unique - blocks are scattered around every stage and they hide blue crystals, and the bigger they are, the more money they're worth. Special items (including a better gun, missiles, smart-bombs and energy tanks) are also hidden under these blocks and can be purchased in exchange of the precious crystals. Each level is split into three areas - first the main zone with a smaller boss awaiting at the end of it, then the player enters a sub-stage plunged in the dark where only his gun can get him to see what is ahead of him. The only way to get the light back is to destroy the nearby generator and rush all the way to the exit... to the boss' lair. Defeat him to complete the area and fly to the next stage !

		<desc>In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. 

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. 

Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. 

Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds : 

The first maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze two times before moving on to the next maze. 

The second maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze three times before moving on to the next maze. 

The third maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only one set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

The fourth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

After Round 13, the game alternates every four rounds between the third and fourth mazes. 

Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different from those of the original game. 

As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present : 

1) Act I - They Meet : Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky while Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the two of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2. 

2) Act II - The Chase : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5. 

3) Act III - Junior : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to "Jr. Pac-Man". 

No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

		<desc>A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.

The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive.

		<name>Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion (Japan 930713) </name>
		<desc>A 1-on-1 fighting game in which players choose from 10 different wrestlers and take to the ring to try and defeat their larger-than-life opponents. Each wrestler has an assortment of moves, including his own special 'super slam'. The object of the game is to win and defend the championship by pinning or putting a submission hold on your opponent.

There are 2 different game modes to select and play : Single Match or Tag Team 'Battle Royal'. In Single Match, players choose to be one of eight wrestlers including 'Mike Hagger', 'Alexander The Grater', 'El Stingray', 'King Rasta Mon', 'Titanic Tim', 'Gunloc', 'Biff Bolshevik' and 'The Great Oni' ('Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion' cannot be selected in this game).

Once a wrestler has been selected, players will compete in a world-wide tournament against the other 9 wrestlers (including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion') in respective matches. In each match, players must defeat each of their respective opponents by a pinfall, count-out or submission in order to proceed to each of the following matches. Once all opponents are defeated, the winner will be crowned champion and players will have to face all opponents again to defend their title.

In Tag Team 'Battle Royal', players can choose to play as any 2 of the 10 wrestlers for their tag team, including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion'. Here, the player and his or her partner have to eliminate both of the 2 wrestlers on the opposing tag team, in order to win the match and proceed to the next. During these matches, if the player is eliminated before his or her partner is, the match will be declared no contest and it will be a draw.

During each bout in this game, metal buckets and/or glass bottles will sometimes be thrown into the ring which can be picked by the players' wrestler(s) and used as weapons against their opponents.

		<desc>A maze/shooting game. 

On this fun game the player controls a naughty boy who goes through the forest and must defend himself throwing rocks at monsters to destroy them. The longer you hold down the fire button, the farther your character can throw rocks. The boy must avoid a variety of monsters and obstacles while attempting to make it to the top of each level and proceed on to the next. There are a number of flags at the top of each level on a fortress that must be destroyed in order to proceed to next level.

Occasionally, there is a bonus round where your character fly back and forth at the top of the screen in a hot-air balloon in an attempt to drop rocks down upon a big monster that is running at the bottom of the screen to hit directly over his head. There is a fuel gauge that determines when the bonus round will end.

		<name>NBA Jam (rev 2.00 02/10/93) </name>
		<desc>2.00 USD. Nonetheless, the game was a smash hit.

NBA Jam was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games (It was the first game to be officially licensed by the NBA (National Basketball Association)), and was also one of the first sports games to feature real teams, real players, and their real digitized likenesses. However, the unrealism of the game was the major drawing point, as the high flying dunks (often featuring players jumping twice their own height in the air while making highly acrobatic slams) were the games' signature. Of course, seeing NBA superstars like Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal flying through the air with the greatest of ease brought just as many fans back. In time, players discovered another major feature of the game, as it was filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations.

Nemo finds himself unable to find the Princess however, so he and 'Flip', a strange companion who also turns up in the dream, decide to explore Slumberland and find the king.

Nemo is a colourful and abstract platform shoot-em-up set in the dream world of Slumberland, a surreal world in which childrens' toys are running amok and must be destroyed. Nemo is armed with a magical staff that emits a burst of magic to destroy the many enemies, some of which require multiple hits. A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages.

		<desc>You're in the drivers seat and the track is just ahead of you on the television screen. Your car is permanently fixed at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the diagram. All you have to do is accelerate and steer the car through one of the four tracks. Each time you veer off the track and hit one of the pylons or hit an oncoming car, a simulated crash scene will appear on the screen.

Game variations:
GANES 1, 2, 3 and 4 are timed. At the beginning of each of these games, a "clock" will begin counting down from 90 (seconds) at the upper right corner of the screen.

GAMES 5, 6, 7, and 8 have no time limit. They may be played for an indefinite period of time and there will not be a clock counting down on the screen.

GAMES 1 and 5 have the easiest track (NOVICE) and should be used by beginning players. Games 2 and 6 have the medium difficulty track (PRO). The EXPERT track in GANES 3 and 7 is more difficult than the NOVICE or PRO tracks.

All of the tracks described so far (GANES 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) are stored in the program memory of the game. So even though the NOVICE, PRO and EXPERT tracks are progressively more difficult, each track will always follow a fixed course. This makes it possible for players to eventually memorize the track as their driving skill increases.

The RANDOM track, however (GANES 4 and 8), follows a different course each time, making it challenging for the most skilled players.

		<desc>When playing this game, you are the pilot of an Omegan Space Fighter in training to defend Omega's Star Colonies. You are stationed in space to destroy as many waves of attacking enemy droid ships as possible.

You begin your training with a small number of droid ships in the first wave of attackers and gradually build your skill until there is a maximum number of 12 attacking droid ships per wave. These attaching ships not only move independently and fire at you, they also drop two different kinds of space mines to block your path and your shots at them.

As your skill level increases, the speed with which the droid ships attack is gradually increased and their shots at you become more accurate.

Bonus ships are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each enemy ship and mine has a point value.

The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while destroying as many attacking droid ships and space mines as you can. As you do this, each following wave of attackers will be harder to destroy.

		<desc>A great and pioneer fixed vertical space shoot'em up game. 

The Ozma wars has begun, and the player controls a spacecraft which must fend off UFOs, spaceships meteors, and comets in a varied of space levels. Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly diminishing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily and a large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and dock with the player's spacecraft, allowing the energy to be refilled. There are 3-4 recognizable stages as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear. After these, the mothership will appear, and the cycle starts over; this continues indefinitely until the energy reaches zero.

		<name>P-47 - The Freedom Fighter (Japan) </name>
		<desc>P-47 is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.

The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air. Regardless of which part you are on, you will still have to deal with the same basic things. After part two of mission four, the missions will repeat again with mission one.

		<desc>Basically this game is "Pac-Man", with a few minor differences. The major difference is that the ghosts have fewer restrictions on their movement, making them more formidable. Also adding to the challenge are the different mazes and the fact that the fruit no longer stays in one place, but moves in, out and around the maze. Fortunately there is a power pellet in each corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

This is "Ms. Pac-Man" with a color change and a new name. Also, the Midway name has been removed although the Midway logo is still there.

		<desc>One or two players control safari-suited characters armed with harpoon guns, who must destroy the numerous different-sized balloons that litter each stage. When hit by a harpoon, the balloons break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari's 1979 classic, "Asteroids".

Players can only fire the harpoon guns virtually upwards, but can move left and right, as well as climbing the ladders that appear on many of the levels. Each of the game's fifty levels is played against a backdrop of one of seventeen famous world landmarks. All balloons must be destroyed before players can advance to the next screen.

The game's levels each contain a different layout of blocks. While most of these are permanent fixtures, some disappear when shot, while others reveal hidden bonuses. Food item bonuses occasionally appear that can be collected for bonus points.

Player start each stage armed with only a single-shot harpoon, but some balloons, when popped, release special weapons that drop down to the bottom of the screen. Players then have a few seconds to collect the power-up before it disappears. Available power-ups are:
* A twin harpoon that allows two shots at once.
* A grappling hook that will stay attached to the ceiling or block for a short period of time.
* A rapid-fire gun. 

Other non-weapon bonuses include:
* A force field.
* An hour-glass that slows the balloons' movement.
* A clock that freezes the balloons for a short time.
* An extra life.
* Dynamite, that will pop all remaining balloons down to their smallest size.

		<desc>The second sequel to the superb 1989 original, Pang! 3 retains the same gameplay of its predecessors but adds vastly improved graphics and a choice of three difficulty levels; Beginner, Normal and Panic. On both the 'Normal' and 'Panic' skill levels, players can choose from 4 different playable characters; each possessing different strengths and weaknesses, such as a double harpoon or quick shots. On the beginner level, players can only use the Mexican character.

Another notable difference is in the game's use of backdrops : instead of the world landmarks of the first two games, Pang! 3 features classical works of art in the form of paintings and sculptures.

		<desc>As Pengo the Penguin, you race around the ice field rearranging huge blocks of ice. Your objectives: Destroy your opponents, the Sno-Bees, before they sting you; and line up three diamond blocks for a fortune in bonus points.

Use your joystick controller to move Pengo around the ice field. Press the lower fire button to kick an ice block accross the playfield or to crush an ice block that is trapped against the wall or against another block.

Squash the Sno-Bees by pushing ice blocks into them or by running Pengo over them when they are frozen. Line up the three diamond blocks by crumbling and kicking strategic ice blocks around the field until all three diamond blocks adjoin.

Each round is completed when you destroy all the Sno-Bees or when the last one escapes. The game ends when you lose your last Pengo life.

		<desc>Pengo the Penguin is the eponymous star of Pengo the video game. The basic layout of Pengo is akin to that of Namco's legendary "Pac-Man"; featuring, as it does, a top down, single screen, maze-like arrangement. Pengo's enemies, the Sno-Bees, are also similar to Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde - the ghosts that pursued Pac-Man; not least because Sno-Bees also come in four different varieties, each represented by a different color.

One aspect that distinguishes Pengo from the Namco classic is that the Maze itself is a wholly interactive environment. Each section of wall is represented as a block of ice, which can be pushed onto the Sno-Bees to destroy them. The Sno-Bees themselves will destroy the ice blocks as they move around each level, so speed is of the essence. Some of the blocks are 'Diamond blocks' which cannot be destroyed, and can be re-used by Pengo.

The outer wall of each level can also be utilized; if the player pushes against the wall when a Sno-Bee is next to it, the Sno-Bee will be temporarily stunned, allowing Pengo to move in for the kill.

		<desc>Peter Pack Rat is a platform game in which the player, controlling the game's hero, a rat called Peter; must rush around a platform-filled screen collecting a variety of objects to take back to Peter's nest. These objects include bottles, watches, hats, balls, and cans.

A number of enemy creatures hinder the player's progress; these include rats, cats, dogs, bats and owls. There are 3 different levels to play through; a junkyard, a sewer and a tree.

As well as the objects that must be collected and taken to Peter's nest, additional objects can also be collected and thrown to stun attacking animals. Flying animals that have been stunned can be ridden around the screen for a short period of time. A round ends when all the desired objects have been collected and placed in the nest. Successive rounds add more objects and enemies, as well as changing the patterns of the shortcuts.

		<name>Phoenix (Amstar) </name>
		<desc>In ancient times, legend says, there was a bird of great beauty. About the size of an eagle, it had brilliant scarlet and gold feathers, a melodious song, and was the only one of its kind in the entire world.

This fabulous creature lived in Arabia and had a life span of over five hundred years. At the end of its life, the phoenix built a nest of frankincense, myrrh, and other aromatic spices. After setting fire to the nest by rapidly beating its wings, the beautiful bird settled down to die amidst the flames.

From the ashes of that fire miraculously arose a young, revitalized Phoenix. This new bird then took the remains of its parent to the temple of the sun at Heliopolis in Egypt, and sacrificed them on the high altar.

The long life of the Phoenix and the dramatic rebirth from its own ashes has made this legendary bird a symbol of immortality and spiritual rebirth in many cultures. The Egyptians saw the myth as a symbol of the life cycle of the sun, which dies every day at sunset and is reborn every morning at dawn.  Most others interpret the legend as a general symbol for the regeneration of life after death.

However, something awful has happened to tarnish the long-standing image of the Phoenix. Due to the effects of radioactive fallout on its nest, the Phoenix has unfortunately mutated into a bird of prey.

Now, several birds arise from the ashes, but these are not like the beautiful, friendly bird of old.  These birds are mean. Their cries areshrill. They have developed a tough, metallic-like skin that makes them almost indestructible. And they have turned their backs on the human race to offer their services to alien beings determined to drain away earth's energy resources.

Your mission: Eliminate these seemingly immortal war hawks, destroy the alien spaceship, and safeguard our planet from ravaging energy-thieves.

You have five lives in which to survive the bombing attacks of four separate flocks of Phoenix war birds who protect the alien spaceship. Your challenge is to eliminate the birds, get to the spaceship that follows the fourth wave of birds, and shoot the alien pilot.

To eliminate the large, menacing Phoenixes of the third and fourth waves, you have to hit them in the center. If you only wing a Phoenix, like its ancient ancestor, it will soon regenerate the missing part and become a whole bird to attack you some more.

To destroy the alien pilot, you have to erode the multi-colored hull of the spaceship directly beneath the cockpit to create a clear shot at him. But one of the hull layers - the blue layer - rotates the length of the spaceship. So, you not only have to chip away at the blue  layer, but you also have to time your shot at the alien to coincide with the hole passing directly under him.

		<name>Phozon (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Phozon is an unusual puzzle/arcade hybrid in which the player controls a black molecule with four red spikes. The idea is for the player to align other floating molecules onto their own molecule to create an increasingly complex pattern; this must match the "blue print" molecule that is situated in the middle of the screen. To make molecules adhere to the player's molecule, the player simply touches the target molecule with their own. If a molecule attaches in a place that does not fit the pattern shown in the middle of the screen, the player must press the reject button to make if float away. Groups of multi-coloured rotating spheres move around the screen and must be avoided.

		<desc>Pipi &amp; Bibis is a platform game for one or two players, in which the aim is to infiltrate buildings and plant time bombs at the computer terminals that litter the levels. The planting of the final bomb starts the detonation sequence, players must then quickly reach the level's exit before the bombs explode.

Each level is populated with enemy scientists and agents, and any contact with these will result in the loss of a life. To help combat this, players are armed with a 'stun gun' which will knock the enemy to the floor, allowing the player to pass. If an enemy is held in the stun gun's beam for several seconds, the enemy will fall to the platform below.

At the completion of each level, part of a cartoon picture of woman in a state of undress is shown. The entire picture is revealed once every four levels.

		<name>Pleiads (bootleg) </name>
		<desc>Pleiads is a 2-D, space shooter style game. With its many interesting visual and audio effects, this game is sure to challenge the most avid player.

Each round of play includes 4 different stages. With the onset of the melodious background tune, the first stage of play begins.

Against a backdrop of planets and twinkling stars, the Earth City must be protected from sixteen attacking Martians. These Martian attackers have the ability to transform from flying Martians, to walking Martians, or to UFOs. The walking Martians build barriers across the Earth City. These barriers must be destroyed.

The Earth Spaceship can be maneuvered right and left. With the use of the 'warp' button, it can be randomly relocated when necessary. These, plus a backup of stationary defense weapons, aid in protecting the Earth City and Spaceship, as well as in destroying the Martian Attackers. When all but the two final Martians have been destroyed, a tone of dusk shades the Earth City. As these two attackers meet their end, the Earth Spaceship ascends into space to meet the challenge of Stage II.

In this second stage of play, the Earth Spaceship encounters eight Space Monsters. To destroy these Monsters, they must be hit in the direct center. When a Space Monster with burning wings is destroyed, up to 400 points can be added to your score. When all the Space Monsters have been destroyed, the Earth Spaceship prepares for Stage III.

In this third stage of play, the Earth Spaceship is confronted with the Martian Space Battleship and its unseen forces. This Martian Battleship contains five closed chambers, each protected by a rocket flame. Each chamber opens periodically at random, to release a defending reserve of Martian attackers. When a flame below an open chamber is extinguished, point value of the Martian Space Battleship increases. This enemy ship can be destroyed by either eliminating all sixteen Martian attackers, or by extinguishing all five rocket flames. When the Martian Space Battleship finally explodes, the Earth Spaceship moves on to Stage IV.

This last stage of play begins with an emergency signal, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. The Earth Spaceship is now ready to be guided on its journey, through a landing corridor, back to its home base. The Earth Spaceship must be carefully maneuvered around other spaceships in order to avoid destruction. Clearing flags will add bonus points to your score. When the Earth Spaceship has been safely maneuvered to its arrival target, 500 to 4,000 points will be added to your score, while bursts of fireworks greet your arrival and signal the beginning of a new round of play.

		<desc>Polaris is a 1-player, single screen shoot-em-up, baring many similarities to Taito's most famous shoot-em-up, "Space Invaders", in which a player takes on the role of Commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. War has been declared and the Polaris' mission is to defend the country from enemy attack.

In battle, players must defend against wave after wave of enemy planes (fighter jets and missile-dropping bi-planes) as well as enemy subs and destroyers. Players must also be careful to avoid the many mines and depth charges that litter the ocean.

War has been declared and you find yourself deep in enemy water with no help. In your battle, you will be required to defend against wave after wave of enemy planes and dive bombers. To make things worse, the enemy has sent their own subs and destroyers. in the course of your battles, you will need to maneuver through dangerous channels full of mines. Don't expect a short war and the battles get rougher, how many of the enemy can you destroy before they get you.

		<name>Pole Position </name>
		<desc>Pole Position is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at the Fuji Speedway in Japan. The country around the speedway consists of green meadows, hills, and snow-capped Mt. Fuji. 

The player drives a Formula-1 race car on the track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the clock, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives out the remainder of the time along the qualifying course. 

As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to the 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. He or she is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). 

The game starts with the player's car behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses.

If the player has qualified, just before the race begins, the player's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap. (The player's car is always place at the 8th position in the attract mode.)

The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, road signs, and water puddles. (All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion. The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car. 

Racing into the first turn, the player must let up on the accelerator slightly to make the corner. Road signs flash along the side of the track. Depending on how well the player manipulates the controls, he or she can either roar through the hairpin turns like a champion or spin out in a flaming crash. He or she jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. 

The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last.

		<name>Pole Position (Atari version 1) </name>
		<desc>POLE POSITION consists of two races: the Qualifying Lap and the Grand Prix. In both races you're racing against time and other cars. The longer you race and the more cars you pass, the more points you score. You earn 10,000 points for completing a lap and 50 bonus points for each car you pass. A lap is one complete circuit of the race course.

The Qualifying Lap is 90 seconds long, but you must complete it in 73 seconds (L/73''00) or less to qualify for a position in the Grand Prix.

If you don't qualify, you can continue racing until the Race Timer counts down to zero. Then your car stops, a bonus for the number of cars passed is added to your score, and the game ends.

If you qualify, your car is positioned for the Grand Prix and a bonus for qualifying is added to the 10,000 points you scored for completing the lap. The faster your lap time, the better your position and the bigger your qualifying bonus. Go for POLE POSITION, the number one starting spot. It's worth 4000 bonus points.

In the Grand Prix, your object is to finish the race in the shortest possible time. At the end of the last lap, a time bonus for each second left on the Race Timer is added to your score, in addition to a bonus for the number of cars passed.

The race is four laps long. Complete each lap before the Race Timer runs out to earn 'extended play' time and go on racing. If the timer runs out before you finish a lap, your car stops, your passing bonus is added to your score, and the game ends.

		<name>Pole Position (Atari version 2) </name>
		<desc>The spectacular arcade game, Pole Position, takes on an exciting new look through the magic of Vectrex! Experience all the challenge of a Grand Prix racing event with non-stop action that'll leave you breathless!

Do you possess the skill, dexterity and courage to pull out from the crowd for qualification in one of the exclusive starting positions... or will you end up as an also ran?

Pole Position transports you into the exciting sport of world class Grand Prix auto racing.  Buckle yourself into your high performance Formula I racer, adjust your safety helmet and get ready for an exhilarating and danger-filled challenge.

You first goal in Pole Position is to race through a lap fast enough to qualify for one of the four exclusive starting positions -- passing competitors and avoiding hazardous obstacles along the way.  Once you have qualified, your challenge continues into four successive laps as you race to maintain your position and complete laps in progressively shorter time periods.

As the game begins, you'll find yourself at the starting line of the world renowned Fuji Speedway.  The words "Prepare To Qualify" will travel across the screen and you will hear the sound of your engine starting. The moment your engine sound begins, you should take off on your qualifying lap. Press buttons 3 or 4 to accelerate.  When you hear your engine laboring, change to second gear by pressing button 2.  (Your speed will never exceed 135 m.p.h. in first gear.) You can return to first gear during your lap by pressing button 1.

While you speed through your qualifying lap, be sure to avoid your competitors' racers and the treacherous obstacles in the roadway -- contact will mean loss your car! There will be no warning of obstacles, so pay close attention to the condition of the track.  Steer your car to avoid hazards and gain a better track position by pushing the joystick either left or right.

Although you are provided with an unlimited number of cars in Pole Position, you will lose a great deal of time whenever a car is crashed. So be careful! It is possible to drive off the speedway track -- but doing so will slow you down, cost you valuable time and increase your chances of losing a car.

You are provided with 120 seconds to complete your qualifying lap although you must complete the lap well ahead of 120 seconds to qualify for on of the four starting positions.  If you qualify, you will be provided with 90 seconds to complete your first actual race lap. Completion of the first lap within the 90 second time period permits you to continue with a second, third and fourth lap which must be completed in 60 seconds.  During the actual race, the time remaining on the clock after completion of a lap will be carried over to the next lap -- allowing you more than the usual time provided to complete the lap.

Game play will continue until you are unable to complete a lap in the allowable time or when you have completed all four race laps. If you complete all four laps, you'll receive 200 bonus points for each second remaining on the clock!

You will also earn points for distance traveled on the track, competitor's cars passed, and having achieved a starting position on your qualifying lap.

		<name>Pole Position II </name>
		<desc>Pole Position II is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at four different raceways - the Fuji Speedway in Japan, the Test Track (an oval track like Indy), the Seaside Speedway (with the Long Beach Pike in the background), and the Suzuka Speedway in Japan. The unique and picturesque scenery around each raceway adds exciting realism to each race! 

The player drives a Formula-1 race car on each track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the time, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives the remainder of his time along the qualifying course. 

As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible, and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. The player is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). 

To start play, the player must first insert the correct number of coin(s) for a game (according to the coin dip switch settings, 1 coin/1 credit is the default for both 'Coin A' and 'Coin B' dips). The player then turns the steering wheel until the track he or she wants to drive on is highlighted in white. The game starts when the player steps on the accelerator. The player's car will appear behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses. 

If the player has qualified, just before the race begins, the player's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap. (The player's car is always placed at the 8th position in the attract mode.) 

The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, water puddles, and road signs. (All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion (Pole Position II adds flying debris to the visual effect). The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car even more than in the original "Pole Position". 

Experience will teach the player which turns on which tracks require slight steering (because they're banked) and which turns require fast and forceful steering. The player jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the track and the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. 

The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appear last. Each track has its own separate high score list.

		<name>Pomping World (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Pomping World is the conversion by Hudson Soft of the popular arcade game originally developed by Capcom. The goal of the game is extremely simple: The player (or 2 simultaneously) has to clean up all the huge colored bouncing spheres on screen. But, in a way similar to Atari's Asteroid, each time a ball is hit, it pops and splits in two, and in two, and so on - all in all, a standard ball can split up to eight times. And if a ball, even tiny, hits the player then he loses a precious life. The player can use several weapons to pop them up, from standard vertical Harpoons to fast Laser-Guns. But the player must watch out for the small creatures that wonder around the play field and that will freeze the active weapon for a short amount of time. Power-ups of course appear from time to time to help our bubble-buster in his journey, such as freeze-time options and special hook that can stick to walls. The game is divided into different group of stages which all represent a different location in the World like the Taj Mahal or Paris. (this feature certainly reminds us of Capcom's Street Fighters).

		<name>Popeye (bootleg) </name>
		<desc>Popeye is a superb and demanding platform game featuring characters from the famous King Features Syndicate cartoon show of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus (originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return).

Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Swee'Pea, the Sea Hag, and her vulture Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.

		<name>PuckMan (Japan set 1) </name>
		<desc>Puckman is the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Puckman around a single-screen maze eating dots. Puckman is constantly pursued in his task by four colored ghosts. Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Puckman losing a life. When all of Puckman's lives are lost, the game is over.

Power pills are situated in each corner of the rectangular maze and eating one of these makes Puckman temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Puckman. But watch out...a flashing blue ghost indicates that the power pill is about to wear off and the ghosts are about to transform back to their former selves again. Once Puckman eats a blue ghost, this 'skinned' ghost then becomes visible as a pair of eyes only, will return to the ghost pen in the middle of the maze, regenerate into its former self, and return to the maze to continue its pursuit of Puckman. 

Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 power pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty (the action increases in speed and power pills decrease in effectiveness). 

Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghost pen. Puckman can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on each side of the maze that Puckman can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Puckman, making escape a little easier. 

Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Puckman and the ghosts in funny situations. Three intermissions are present: 
1) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, having turned blue, followed by a giant Puckman! This intermission is played after Round 2. 
2) The red ghost is again chasing Puckman, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. 
3) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then the ghost reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Rounds 9, 13 and 17. 

No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

		<desc>The player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, who must fight his way through six increasingly larger-than-life boxers to earn the title of 'Champ' in this superb 1-on-1 fighting game.

During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wire-frame (so the player's opponent can be seen). Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer.

The player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.

		<desc>Puzzle Club is a sliding block puzzle video game. The objective of each stage is to make every row in the puzzle show matching animated icons before the timer reaches zero. Once a row is matched that row is shifted to the bottom of the puzzle.  Once all of the rows are matched the stage is completed and the players score is tallied.

There is a 'young' mode and 'adult' mode that is selected at the start of the game. The 'young' mode features icons and characters from the pac-man series.  The 'adult' mode features standard slot game icons. The 'adult' mode also features a bonus stage between regular stages, featuring a sliding puzzle with the animated image of a girl lifting barbells. If the player solves the puzzle within the short time limit he is awarded extra bonus points.

Jumping on anything green is safe, catching the turtle slows down enemies for a short time and catching the freeze ball freezes enemies for a short time.

Each level has four rounds and a bonus round and there are 11 levels...
Level 1 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 2 colors
Level 2 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 3 colors
Level 3 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes have 6 colors from this point on
Level 4 : get 2 tic-tac-toes
Level 5 : get 3 tic-tac-toes
Level 6 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 7 : get 2 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 8 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 9 : get 4 tic-tac-toes
Level 10 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 11 : get 3 tic-tac-toes

After this levels 9-11 repeat indefinitely.

		<desc>The objective of Qix is to claim a certain proportion of the playing field as your own. At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.

The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.

		<name>R-Type (US) </name>
		<desc>R*Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.

The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R*Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.

The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R*Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage.

R*Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.

		<name>R-Type Leo (World) </name>
		<desc>The third and final arcade release of this classic series (which would foster three further console-only sequels, see 'Series' for details) sees the Bydo Empire waging a full scale assault against other planets. 

R*Type Leo possesses many of the elements that made the first two games in the series such classics, but the feel and gameplay is very different. Both the beam laser and the pod make a return, but play a different role in this game. The pod in particular now acts more like a mini 'smart bomb', in that it only detaches from the player's ship for a few seconds, and automatically homes in on enemies. The level design is also far more open than that of its predecessors, and far more forgiving.

R*Type Leo is a game that firmly divides opinions of fans of the series. Some considered it to be a blasphemy to the R*Type name, arguing that in making a game far more 'traditional', both in feel and level design, R-type Leo actually represented a step backwards from what the innovative original achieved. Less patient players undoubtedly prefer Leo's open levels and forgiving gameplay. Something that all can agree on, however, is how stunningly beautiful the game is. The detail and use of colour on both the backgrounds and enemy ships is incredible and is one of the finest examples of two-dimensional artwork the arcade has ever seen.

		<desc>As captain of the Sonic Spaceport, players must defend their station against enemy spaceships called Gamma Raiders, which attack with vengeance and swiftly retreat to formation. The object of the game is to destroy 48 enemy Gamma Raiders before there is total disintegration of all the Spaceports on the player's side.

Players can counterattack with the Rapid-Fire Laser Blaster which zooms the lasers over the three-dimensional-esque field of curving vectors, while it intercepts enemies. The lower on the radar screen that you destroy a Gamma Raider, the more points will be earned. If exploding decoys damage the Sonic Spaceport, the Laser Blaster's firing speed will reduce. The Laser Blaster's "Damage Meter" will light up as damage is incurred and when fully illuminated, will weaken the Laser Blaster's offensive powers. To reverse this, the players must attack and destroy all remaining Gamma Raiders.

Players are given a wide range of flexibility in controlling the difficulty levels of the game. Extra Spaceports are awarded at 7,000, 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 points, as determined by the players. The initial number of Spaceports may also be pre-programmed at 3, 4, 5 or 6. When the required number of spaceships is destroyed, players receive an extra point bonus.

		<name>Rampage (ver 2 8-4-86) </name>
		<desc>Rampage is a classic B-movie inspired smash-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of three mutated monsters - George the giant ape, Lizzie the giant lizard and Ralph the giant wolf - who move from city to city destroying skyscrapers and vehicles, while eating or killing any people that get in their way. 

The monsters' health can be damaged in a number of ways: by being shot by National Guardsmen, by being hit by another monster, by falling from a building, by being hit by police cars or tanks, by going underwater, by being struck by lightning, or by eating something bad, such as dynamite. Health is replenished by eating food found in damaged buildings. 

If the players' health gauge diminishes completely, the monsters will revert back to their original human form and walk sideways off the screen. Rampage has a "buy back in" option, however; if players chose to continue the game before the human figure leaves the play area, the game will continue from that stage. 

Rampage is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in Peoria, Illinois and ends in Plano, Illinois. In Plano, players receive a mega vitamin bonus which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day One. 

* Examples of bonuses and hazards found inside damaged buildings: 
Food: Milk, Turkey, Hot Toast, Fruit 
Bonus: Flower Pot, TV Set, Money Bag 
Hazard: Cactus, Poison, Toaster 

* Examples of bonuses and hazards found outside damaged buildings: 
Bonus: Auto (or Truck), Commuter Train, Person in Manhole 
Hazard: National Guard Tank, Police Car, Storm Cloud 

Further bonus points can be earned by grabbing a fleeing 'Townie' from a building window. This has two benefits: 1) While holding the Townie, all swat team members disappear from the building windows and 2) accumulating points are scored during the time the Townie is held.

		<desc>A platform hack 'n' slash game from Taito in which a single player guides a barbarian hero through a number of fantasy-themed levels, fighting through swathes of mythological fantasy creatures, including orcs, skeletal warriors and multi-headed hydra.

More powerful weapons can be picked up, as well as bonus items that can increase the barbarian hero's health and give increased protection against enemy attack. Players should be wary that some collectable items are cursed and will have a detrimental effect on the hero's health and performance. Unlimited continues are available throughout the game.

Last Alert is a military action game and the player's goal is to guide Guy Kazama and stop the evil Dr. Garcia, helped by an arsenal of different weapons and other offensive items. The game counts six vast areas, from a gigantic enemy base to a deep jungle or snowing and icy terrain. Levels are split into different sub-missions. You will either have to clean up an area and defeat the boss, or strategically drop bombs or rescue hostages. You start with a simple shot gun, but you can acquire more experience as you defeat enemies and gain levels and classes. As your ranks gets higher, you access better and more powerful weapons.

		<name>Red Baron (Revised Hardware) </name>
		<desc>2,795 at its release. Only 504 units were produced.

Red Baron was designed to accurately recreate World War I aerial combat. It was definitely the first flight simulator available to the public back in 1980. Red Baron was a lot like "Battlezone" in the air. Which made a lot of sense, because Red Baron ran on almost exactly the same hardware as Battlezone (more information below), and most Red Baron Upright machines shipped in factory-converted Battlezone cabinets (they usually even have Battlezone sideart underneath the red 'Iron Cross' sideart). Unfortunately this game never did as well as Battlezone did, the game did poorly in the arcades. Maybe the world just wasn't ready for a 3-D flight simulator?

Red Baron used almost the exact same hardware as Battlezone, but not quite. Battlezone will run on Red Baron hardware with a few minor modifications, but Red Baron will not run on Battlezone hardware without a Red Baron 'auxiliary board', as the Battlezone auxiliary board did not have enough sockets for all the Red Baron ROM chips. The two games control completely different though.

		<name>Riot City (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Riot City is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the roles of 'Paul' or 'Bobby', two talented fighters who are given the task of breaking a drug syndicate known as "MID". It has also been discovered that Paul's girlfriend has been kidnapped by the syndicate and must be rescued.

MID's hideout is located on Riot Island, an island full of abandoned, run-down buildings that has since become a slum. Locations include apartments, a hospital, a factory and a casino.

Riot City is practically a direct copy of Capcom's superb 'Final Fight', with both gameplay and graphical style heavily copied from the 1989 classic. One gameplay difference is that Riot City does not allow players to pick up and use weapons as they can in Final Fight, although bonus items found in various containers can be collected.

		<desc>The goal of the game is to jump out of the plane and land safely on one of the many targets down below. The challenge is to avoid the numerous enemy helicopters that occupy the sky in between your plane and the ground.

You control the timing of your jump with the Jump button, at which point your parachutist begins hurtling toward the ground out of control. Pressing the D-Ring button shortly afterwards releases the chute and slows your descent. More importantly, it allows you at this point to control your left/right position via the paddle control to help you avoid the enemies.

You can select any of the 16 different game play options. Each game play option determines the number of available fuel cells and which characters can wraparound the screen.

Your pirate-destroying ship will appear on the right side of the screen. In a two player game, a second pirate-destroying ship will appear on the left side of the screen.  Your fuel cells will be in the center. You must guard your fuel cells from the pirates who will try to steal them. The pirates can appear from anywhere on the screen. Steer your ship with either the joystick or buttons 1 and 2, for left and right rotation. Move your ship forward by pressing button 3. Press button 4 to fire lasers at the pirates. The pirates can be destroyed by colliding with them, but you will then have to wait for your new pirate-destroying ship to appear before you can fire more lasers. The game is over when all the fuel cells are stolen.

		<desc>Everyone knew the war was coming. Tensions had been building for months - not between the Superpowers as had always been thought, but between rival factions in our own government. What no one expected was the severity of the damage.

Nuclear weapons devastated the surface of the planet, released by ruthless Death Squads intent on controlling the planet. Millions perished in a sudden flash of heat more intense than a Sahara summer.

When it was all over, only a handful of decent people remained. A few good people, and thousands of Death Squad members. It was obvious that the Death Squads had planned this for years. They were ready. They had developed cities and weapons impervious to nuclear war. And vehicles. They had cars that could withstand the highest levels of radiation and the most dangerous heat. They also had huge stockpiles of food and medicine that would keep them alive until the nuclear winder ends.

Fortunately, a right-thinking scientist saw what was happening. He defected from the Death Squads and brought with him a small prototype vehicle and a few weapons capable of destroying Death Squad cars and cannon towers. Only one person can fit in the prototype, and you were chosen.

Now, just for the amusement of Death Squad leaders, there is to be a road rally, a dangerous race for time and distance along a highway laced with deadly mines and cannon towers. Posing as a Death Squad driver you join the rally, hoping to drive undetected into the very heart of the Death Squad territory where you will defeat their leaders. your only helper is a small, robot-powered jet that will bring you additional weapons from Headquarters. The odds are definitely against you.

The nuclear wind blows dust across the highway. Now and then the burnt skeleton of a tumbleweed blows across the once-fertile plain. The world is desolate. All hope for a decent future rests on your narrow shoulders.

		<name>Robby Roto </name>
		<desc>When playing this game. YOU are ROTO's mentor. He takes his directions ONLY from YOU and will do your bidding exclusively. YOU determine the strategies he will use to defeat the evil monster VOLTAR who has invaded the Earth, stealing all types of treasures and burying them deep within the earth. VOLTAR also takes hostages and seals them in vaults deep within the earth.

There is only one way to save the hostages and recover the stolen treasures. We must send in ROTO. He will follow VOLTAR right into his own home tunnels to rescue the hostages and recover the stolen treasures VOLTAR has salted away.

To say the least, this makes VOLTAR more than just a little bit upset with ROTO. To help protect his stolen treasures and kidnapped hostages. VOLTAR has developed a breed of giant SPIDER that can sense ROTO's location and that can also travel through solid earth. These SPIDERS attempt to corner and capture ROTO. And to direct their hunt for ROTO, VOLTAR turns himself into a TROLL that can travel through solid earth.

If and when ROTO is captured by the SPIDERS or the TROLL, he is forcibly ejected from VOLTAR's tunnels and you loose one player.

As your skill level increases and you get into the higher racks of the game, the ability of the SPIDERS and the TROLL to sense ROTO's location increases. This makes ROTO's chances of survival considerably smaller And VOLTAR, being what he is, has reinforcements in the form of a set of disembodied TEETH that he can call on to help him track ROTO down and put the bite on him. These TEETH also have the ability to travel through solid earth.

ROTO has no reinforcements he can call on to help him defend himself against his enemies. He has ONLY YOUR SKILL at maneuvering and forming strategies plus one use of the MAGIC button (which makes ROTO and any hostages he has with hlm invisible to all monsters for a short period of time) per rack to keep him safe as he carries out his rescue missions.

Bonus ROTOs are awarded to you periodically throughout the game: after you complete every third rack of the game. Each recaptured treasure and rescued hostage has an assigned point value as listed below. In the 2 times and 3 times racks, the values of all items are doubled or tripled respectively.

RoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being into-the-screen target ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Wooden crates occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, but these can be punched to remove them. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun.

The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.

		<name>Robot Bowl </name>
		<desc>You have a top down view of a bowling alley with score cards shown on each side. The only thing in the game that uses an actual animation is the bowler himself, the robot has a several frame animation when he walks. Everything is (of course) shown in glorious monochrome black and white. The game begins with your robot bowler running up to the alley (his feet move faster than he does, which makes it look like he is running on a conveyor belt or something). You then have three seconds to roll the ball, before it will roll of its own accord. The game is controlled with five buttons, they are left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. When Exidy was making this game, they had to make a decision about how the hooking worked, and it seems that they decided that "Robots are telepaths, and can effect the balls movement after it is thrown!". You see you can't even hook the ball until after it is thrown. This makes it very easy to pick up the spare. The game makes up for that little trick by making 'splits' very common (the 7-10 split and the 4-7-10 split come up all the time). These are pretty annoying, but you can usually learn how to clear them out (except the 7-10 split, I still haven't figured out how to clear that one).

		<name>Rockman: The Power Battle (CPS1, Japan 950922) </name>
		<desc>Have you ever pictured a Rockman game that allows to skip all the platform elements and just grapple against the bosses? That's pretty much the main idea in this game! Choose from Rockman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).

		<desc>Yousei Monogatari Rod Land is a cute single-screen platform game by Jaleco, conversion of their own arcade game released back in 1990. The fairy village is under attack and all the inhabitants have been turned into monsters. And yet it was only the beginning. The player takes control of Rin (and/or Tam) whose mother has been kidnapped and kept prisoner at the top of the mysterious Mab?tsu tower standing outside the village. The young fairies don't come empty handed and are equipped with the Sh?sanomo Wand, the last gift they ever received from their adored dad. They can grab enemies with the staff and repeatedly slam the poor foes against the ground to safely dispose of them. They drop special weapons when killed which can then be picked up and used against other enemies - they range from bombs, missiles, bouncing balls and dynamite. As well as the wands, the fairies can use their Rainbow shoes to create magical ladders and reach higher (or lower) grounds. This technique is also particularly suited to escape or track down running enemies. The main goal of the game is to clear each level from monsters, however there is an alternate way. The fairies can also collect all the flowers on screen - this will turn all the left over monsters that survived into red plum/peach looking enemies. In this mode, defeated foes drop letter icons that can be combined to form the word "EXTRA" and award the player with an extra life. A two simultaneous player mode is available and options allow the player to customize the fairies' features (change their color, names and even allow them to jump).

		<desc>The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

		<desc>This game was in black and white, not greyscale (like many early games used), but just 2 colors, black and white. But the characters and animals were large, and very detailed for just using a single color. There were 4 different animals that you could hunt. Snakes and lions were both rather slow moving, and good for 100 points each. Wild boars would run quickly across the screen, but would net you 200 for a kill. Finally, vultures were small and would move around erratically near the top of the screen (being worth 300 points if you could hit them). Touching any of the beasties meant instant death, but it mattered little, because this game played on time limits anyway. Death only meant that you would lose a few seconds waiting for your intrepid big game hunter to reappear (the game lasted 90 seconds total).

Half animal, half machine, the cyborgs have already conquered most of the galaxy and now have their sights set on the galaxy's last hope, 'The Planet of the Golden Dragon'. A lone mechanoid dragon, unhappy with the actions of his comrades, rebels and sets out to thwart their invasion of the Planet of the Golden Dragon.

Saint Dragon is a demanding and playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up, played over six different stages. The tail of the mechanoid dragon the player controls is impervious to enemy attacks and causes damage to any enemy it touches. The head of the dragon is effectively the 'ship' of the game and a direct hit from an enemy will result in the loss of a life.

At various points in a stage bronze-coloured eggs appear which, when shot, release weapon and speed power-ups.

		<name>Satan's Hollow (set 1) </name>
		<desc>Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head. 

The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME! 

Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT : when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN. 

When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player. 

As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also. 

Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value. 

The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.

The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.

		<desc>Watch out for that next mountain! Maneuver your ship over a rough terrain in an effort to destroy the enemy base. Careful piloting alone won't get you to your destination... you must brave rockets, UFOs, flamoids and some very tight tunnels.  Few people have ever seen the enemy base, let alone destroy it. Will you be one of the select few?

Your ship will immediately come into view and the landscape of the first part of your journey will begin moving beneath you. Use the joystick to maneuver your ship across the terrain, avoiding the mountains and other obstacles. Press button 3 to drop bombs. Press button 4 to fire lasers at the obstacles. If you are successful in piloting through that section of the terrain, you will immediately fly to the next, more difficult part of the planet. If you successfully travel through all levels, you will eventually reach the enemy base.

		<name>Scramble (bootleg on Galaxian hardware) </name>
		<desc>Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of a spaceship and must try to fight through six different enemy-packed levels - destroying as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible - before reaching the enemy base and destroying it. 

Contact with any scenery, ground installations, enemy ships or projectyles results in an instant loss of life. The Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs. The blaster is forward-firing only while the bombs drop downwards to target ground-based enemy installations and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. 

The fuel dumps are of particular importance, as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly depletes as the player progresses through the game and the only way to re-fuel is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located on the ground throughout the levels. Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible. 

Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.

		<desc>A great underwater shooter game.

The player start on an dive propulsion vehicle that can fire torpedoes. The mission is to rescue all the hostages and avoid or shoot all enemies that come your way to attack you. If your vehicle runs out of fuel can explode to avoid this must be attentive to the fuel indicator, if your tank is almost finished press the dismount button to get off the vehicle. Now the player is swimming freely and your weapon is a powerful harpoon. If you kill the owner of another dive vehicle you can mount it and use torpedoes again. The number of hostages to rescue increases with each level. When all the hostages have been rescued, the level ends.

		<desc>The game screen is a side view of a underwater scene (with the surface towards the top). You control a crosshair at the surface level. The object is to shoot as many ships as possible, before the time runs out. Your torpedoes are launched from the bottom of the screen, and must move upwards to hit the enemy ships (while avoiding the mines that float at different levels of the water). There are several different types of enemy ships, from slow moving destroyers, to fast moving PT boats. An 'explosion' light will flash inside your periscope each time you score a hit. Your submarine can shoot five shots before it has to reload (an automatic action that takes about a second). Your game will be extended if you reach a certain score before time runs out (the score is operator adjustable).

		<name>Secret Agent (World) </name>
		<desc>Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.

The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.

Most of the game's eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game's end-of-level bosses reappear on the final 'underground lair' level.

While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level.

		<desc>A loose sequel to 1988's "Shinobi", Shadow Dancer stars a young Ninja who, together with his faithful canine companion, must battle against a terrorist group. The terrorist group have planted a number of time bombs throughout the metropolis. The Ninja and his dog must set out to gather up all the explosives placed by the evil gang and to annihilate the criminal mastermind.

Game-play is very similar to that of the original Shinobi, and features the jumping and projectile weapon-based game-play of its illustrious older brother. However, a new and crucial attacking move has since been added to the Ninja's arsenal. Pulling DOWN on the joystick and pressing the ATTACK button sends the hero's dog to attack the nearest enemy. This will stop the enemy from attacking the player as he wrestles with the dog. The enemy must be killed quickly, however, or the dog itself will be killed. If the dog is attacked, he will turn into a small puppy, and once the player has killed a set number of enemies, the puppy will grow to be a full-sized dog who can once again be used to attack enemies.

		<desc>Side Trak is a black &amp; white man-versus-machine game where the goal is to pick up all of the waiting passengers with your train while avoiding the computer-driver 'killer engine' which aims to take you out in a head-on collision. You can control your train via the 'fast' button which allows you to temporarily increase your speed on the tracks. You can also use the joystick to switch between several tracks at various junction points.

Each time you make a complete circuit around the track and pass the start marker on the outside track, another car is added to your train.

		<desc>Your intergalactic crystal-mining mission takes you to the antipodes of the known universe. But your parametric DeepSpace scanner faithfully displays the sector of the galaxy you presently occupy (including an area fully three parsecs across, no less)! 

Keep the galaxy safe for all its sinizens! Fiendish Worker ships from the planet Sporg will attempt to fabricate a Sinistar from the remains of derelict planetoids in your very sector. You must not let them do this for two reasons : 
1) These planetoids contain the life-sustaining crystals that your civilization requires for its vital technologies. 
2) With the eminently unstable Sinistar in their possession, the Sprogites can lay waste to any civilization in your sector. You alone stand in their way. 

You must mine the sinisite crystals. Williams has equipped you with the latest heuristic electret cannon technology. All you need to do is aim at a planetoid and shoot. Now collect your motherlode! 

In fact, only with sinisite can you manufacture sinibombs to eradicate the Sinistar. But you must also rebuff the Workers and disintegrate their even more aggressive comrades-at-arms, the evil skelomorphic Warriors! Intelligent beings everywhere depend on your courage, your dedication, your reserve, your shrewd command of tactical invention! It's up to you, space cadet!

		<desc>This is quite a fun game, where you score points for landing on an ever decreasing patch of 'good' land. Why 'good'? As you descend without opening your parachute your landing point becomes smaller, but the points become higher, just don't leave pulling the ripcord too late because the Newtonian laws concerning gravity is working against you. Each time you successfully land the plane goes lower.

To complete each level you have to drive over, or shoot all of the pellets. If done quickly enough the game will skip a level (going from 1 to 3, etc).

		<desc>How many types of alien vessels will you be able to destroy? Seven different types are after you. You must first destroy them and then attempt to rescue the survivors before that float into the sun. Don't get your ship too close to the sun... its high temperatures can destroy you.

The first group of aliens will fly on to the screen. Use the joystick to rotate your ship and button 3 to move forward. You must try to destroy the ships before they collide with you. To destroy alien vessels one at a time, press button 4 to fire rockets. You can destroy many alien vessels at the same time by using button 2, the Nuke. Press this button once to fire the Nuke and a second time to release its force. The number of remaining Nukes are shown at the bottom of the screen.

Button 1 allows you to move mysteriously on the screen to avoid begin hit.  Use it cautiously... it might put you in an even more difficult predicament.

Once an alien vessel is destroyed, its survivor will remain and float toward the sun in the center of the screen. You can earn extra points by either destroying the survivors or picking them up in your craft before the sun destroys them.

As the game progresses, new types of aliens, who are even faster and more deadly, will enter the field.

		<name>Son Son </name>
		<desc>Son Son is a side scrolling action game by Capcom and conversion of their own arcade game originally released in 1984. It is loosely based on the old Chinese legend Journey to the west and tells the story of a monk and his long pilgrimage to Tenjiku (ancient India) to retrieve Buddhist scriptures. But soon, the monk and his disciples (lead by Son Son the monkey boy) come under attack and are captured by a flying demon-warrior. Only Son Son and Ton Ton (the pig in two-player cooperative mode) manage to escape, and the duo vows to save their friends and to reach their intended destination. Son Son is not your typical platform game, but rather a mix of platform action and shooting. Each one of the twenty levels (or continuous sections) is made out of six large platforms that span across the screen. The playfield constantly scrolls from right to left, encouraging Son Son to always stay on the move and to jump up or down to higher or lower ground in order to avoid incoming enemies or to collect fruits and other special items. Most of the items available in the game, such as fruits and vegetables, are only good for points (additionally, larger ones appear in front of wooden signs and award the player with even more bonus points). The last power-ups are Capcom's familiar and trademark Pow icons (kill all the enemies on the screen and turns them into fruits and vegetables for points), small Bamboo shoots (they grow behind Son Son) and the Yashichi pinwheel for extra bonus points. Every so often, the screen stops for a short amount of time and unveils a tougher battle against skull blocks, bombers and, later in the game, respawning waves of increasingly difficult enemies and large flying demon-warriors.

In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

		<name>Space Fever (New Ver.) </name>
		<desc>The Earth is under attack from alien invaders. Shoot them out of the sky before they land. Space Fever is Nintendo's take on the "Space Invaders" franchise. The game is almost identical in terms of how it plays. The alien craft are arranged in rows and they slowly move left and right across the screen. When the row reaches the edge, the ships drop down a row and move in the opposite direction. As you shoot more enemies the speed will increase, as will the number of enemy bullets. You have four blocks above you that absorb the enemy shots until they are worn through, and being hit by an enemy shot will cost you a life. Sometimes a UFO will fly along the top of the screen and can be hit for Bonus points.

There are three different game modes for 1- or 2-player games :
Game A - There are two 'blocks' of aliens that move in opposite directions to each other.
Game B - The aliens move as one 'block', but they only appear one row at a time.
Game C - The same as "Space Invaders" - all the aliens move as one 'block' in the same direction.

		<name>Space Firebird (Gremlin) </name>
		<desc>Space Firebird is a one or two player game in which players are attacked from all sides by highly maneuverable Firebirds. Players can move space ship left or right and shoot a rapid-fire laser at attacking Firebirds. A special Warp Mode allows the space ship to escape danger and fire at the flock of aliens.

FIREBIRDS
The space Firebirds are a unique set of adversaries. There are three different birds, the Emperor, Eagle and Gull, which fly together in complex looping formations, firing and attacking from all directions. The player must keep track of the laser hits because each bird has a different resistance level to hits. The fearless Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the soaring Gull with one hit. The Eagle also has a deadly bomb which is launched at the space ship. Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.

SPACE SHIP
The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.

WARP MODE
Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.

If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed.

There are four buildings (shields) at the bottom of the screen that the player can hide behind, but these will eventually be destroyed by either enemy missiles or by direct contact with the invaders themselves. The player's shots will also destroy the shields.

The aliens' descent quickens as they are eliminated, making them harder to hit. A flying saucer will fly across the top of the screen at regular intervals and can be shot to earn extra points.

		<name>Spectar (revision 1?) </name>
		<desc>Spectar, released by Exidy in 1980, is the follow-up of "Targ". Gameplay is apparently unchanged, you control a vehicle called Whummel into a 9x9 grid maze, chasing down, and being chased by, the alien invaders. Targs have evolved into the more dangerous Rammers, and Spectars appears more often, shooting at player's ship.

You use a 4-Way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at enemies. Up to 2 players can alternate in gameplay.

The most noticeable difference from his predecessors is that to complete a level you can now collect all the gems in the maze, in a "Pacman"-like game or destroy all of the Rammers (like in "Targ"). Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.

Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor : The maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environment settings, changing from the 'square-block town' of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge.

		<desc>In Speed Freak you drove an extremely fast car along a lonesome road. The idea was simply to drive as fast as you can without crashing. The game was time based, you could crash as much as you wanted, but points were scored for driving as fast and as far as you could without crashing. Your view of the action was from behind the hood of the car, but slightly above what an actual driver would see, kind of like you were sitting on the roof instead of inside the car. Obstacles were mainly oncoming cars (which was always the same one), and police roadblocks. The off-road scenery was limited to stick figure cows, hitchhikers, and the occasional cactus.

Your only goal is to drive around the track as many times as possible, and as fast as you can. There will be four cars on the track at all times (the computer lets you know that 'Grey cars drive automatically').You control the white car, while the computer controls a black car and two grey cars. The game will rate you at the end, you can get rated Granny, Rookie, or Pro, and getting a score over 250 points will extend the game an extra 30 seconds. The game has several different tracks available, and they change randomly throughout the game (they literally change while you are still driving). This is different than the original "Sprint 2", which allowed you to select your track manually. The graphics are simple black and white with two shades of gray thrown in for good measure. They are simple, but they get the job done.

		<name>Star Castle (older) </name>
		<desc>Star Castle is a 1- or 2-player outer space action game designed with features geared for maximum player appeal : A progressively difficult competitive level and a clearly defined enemy which must be both attacked and avoided at various points in the course of play.

The center of the playfield is occupied by the Star Castle which is programmed to constantly home in on the players' ships. Surrounding the Star Castle are three concentric energy rings of twelve segments each, which serve as both a protective perimeter for the Star Castle and a source of points for the player. Contained within the energy rings are three protective mines which seek out the players' ships and destroy them upon collision. The movements of the mines are programmed to simulate the actions of heat-seeking missiles.

The object of the games of Star Castle is to score the maximum number of points possible. This is accomplished by the combination of three elements :
a) Exploding the ring segments.
b) Exploding the Star Castle.
c) Avoiding the Star Castle's mines. A player's turn is over when his ship has been destroyed. The number of ships per game is set by the operator.

For maximum scoring, a player will want to shoot out sections of the energy rings in order to give him a shot at the Star Castle in the center of the screen. As play progresses, there are 2 facts a player must keep in mind :
1) Exploding all segments in a given ring will cause the entire ring to reappear - thereby eliminating a potential shot at the Star Castle in the center.
2) Exploding the rings in a manner that gives you a shot at the Star Castle will also give the Star Castle a shot at you. The Star Castle is programmed so that its nose always seeks out the player's ship. If there is an open shot at the player, it will take it.

When the Star Castle is hit by a player's missile, it will first implode and then explode with all remaining ring segments. After a one-second delay, the Star Castle will reappear with all three ring segments. If the Star Castle shoots the player, his turn is over.

As play begins, the Star Castle will appear in the center of the screen surrounded by its 3 energy rings. The player's ship appears about halfway up on the right hand edge. By using the control buttons to move forward, right or left, the player maneuvers about the screen using the firing button to launch missiles.

Points are scored by destroying the energy ring segments or the Star Castle itself. Exploding the Star Castle gives an extra ship as well as points. No points are given for the mines that attack the player.

The player's ship can be destroyed in 2 ways : By collision with the mines or by a hit from the Star Castle's torpedo. The mines are launched from the rings and attack the player for approximately ten seconds or until shot. The Star Castle's torpedoes are launched only when there is a clear shot at the player through all 3 rings. At this time the player also has his shot at the Star Castle. Both the Star Castle and the mines get smarter and faster as the game progresses.

The game of STAR CASTLE is not based on time units. The battle rages on until all the players' ships are destroyed. The length of the game depends solely on the skill of the player. It's the age-old challenge of man versus machine.

		<desc>You and other experienced intergalactic voyagers have heard about and shared the legend of Star Castle -- a mysterious fortress in a far away galaxy filled with incredible riches and surrounded by revolving walls of shimmering solid gold. Yet no one, until now, has ever actually seen the Castle -- or lived to tell about it!

As you approach, you are overwhelmed with the beauty of the Castle but you suddenly realize that the golden walls hide a deadly arsenal. To survive you must destroy the walls and the powerful Energy Cannon they shield. Perhaps you will be the first to survive the Star Castle's arsenal and prove the legend true. Perhaps not!

		<desc>Even Patton would spend all his quarters attempting to advance through the four attack levels of Strategy X, Konami's latest tank attack video game.

1st Level : Defend against rotating cannons.
2nd Level : Watch out for attacking Jeeps
3rd Level : Careful! Here come attacking and shooting tanks
4th Level : Rotating cannons again, but this time against a moving background.

An audible signal warns that it's refueling time. Enter a fuel dock and receive 100-300 points. The Tank commander's life isn't an easy one.

Aside from an on-going battle, he has to watch out for obstacles and rough terrain. Brick walls destroy tanks, although they can be shot away. TNT, rather nasty stuff...explodes when shot, but destroys all objects in the area. Stay off pink backgrounds. That's where the land mines are buried. They explode only on contact. Don't worry about a blue background, though. It's a slip zone like an oil slick and can be driven across. If an alien base is found and destroyed, advance to the next level of difficulty. You bet there's a 'buy-in' feature on this one.

Strategy X. There's never been a war game like it. It blows minds, and quarters.

		<desc>You begin by choosing one of 2 fighters (either a blond guy, or a dark haired guy in karate gear). Then you are whisked away to one of many cities on the map to have a battle. The opponents are tough, but simple. This game has no special moves (and has only punch, kick, and jump buttons), and all characters have insanely high energy. So you pretty much just wail away at each other with punches and kicks until someone falls down. An ambulance will show up to haul away your defeated opponent, and a girl in the audience will come out to congratulate you

		<desc>Saurian lizard men have overrun all twenty-two planets that form the New Earth Solar System colonies, capturing and mutating the resident human colonies into reptiles to use as slave labour at their stronghold base, the Saurian Mega-Star Apocalypse

In the 3rd game in Midway's seminal "Defender" series, Strikeforce again has the player flying a spaceship over the surface of a series of two-way, horizontally scrolling planets, destroying enemy waves and rescuing humans from the alien invaders; with rescued humans hanging from the underside of the player's ship. Once these tasks have been completed, the mothership arrives to pick up the player's ship, together with any humans they have rescued. Players can decide which planets to attack, when to purchase additional firepower and when to attack the Apocalypse.

Strikeforce's graphics differ from the minimalist, stylish appearance of the first two games in the series; with full colour sprites, multi-layer scrolling and colourful, visceral explosions giving the game its own distinctive look and feel.

		<name>Super Contra (Japan) </name>
		<desc>The sequel to "Contra" - released a year earlier - is set in the year 2634 and begins with the disturbing news that the alien invaders from the first game - a race known as the Red Falcon - have renewed their attack on Earth and have infiltrated military bases and possessed most of the federation forces troops. 

The heroes of the first games - Bill Rizer and Lance Bean - are once again called upon to defend the Earth and defeat the alien invaders. 

Super Contra plays identically to its predecessor, with the usual mix of run-and-gun gameplay. The main difference is that the into-the-screen stages of the original Contra have been replaced with overhead stages. In addition, power-up icons are now represented as the actual weapons wielded by the characters, instead of the traditional letter-based falcon icons and players can now upgrade their weapon by picking it up twice in a row. 

Another new gameplay addition is that players can now control the height of their jump; holding the joystick up and pressing the jump button allows for a higher jump; likewise the player can perform low jumps by holding down-right or down-left while pressing the jump button. 

The available weapons are as follows: 

* Machine Gun - Fires bullets at auto-fire. The upgraded version increases the firing rate to a near-ridiculous speed. 

* Bomb Launcher - Fires bombs that spread fire when they hit their target. The upgraded version causes bigger explosions. 

* Laser Rifle - Fires a powerful laser beam once per shot. The upgraded version fires a larger beam. 

* Spread Shot - Fires a three-way shot. Increases to a five-way spread after the upgrade. 

* Mega Shell - Available only in the top-view stages. After picking it up, players can launch it by pressing the jump button and kill all on-screen enemies. 

Super Contra's five stages are: 

* Area 1 - Outer Base (side-view) - A military base overrun by possessed soldiers. Bosses include a manned tank and a possessed helicopter. At the end of the level, players must destroy a core protected by a pair of snipers and a grenade thrower to gain entrance to the next area. 

* Area 2 - Inner Base (top-view) - A tank hanger filled with manned tanks and cannons, in addition to enemy soldiers. The end-of-level boss is the Hyper Electric Magnetic Tank Magnus, which is manned by three gunners. 

* Area 3 - Jungle (side-view) - Enemies come from trees as players progress through the level. The heroes will sometimes have to cross a lake, and players can duck into it to avoid enemy fire. Towards the end of the level, the heroes are faced with alien eggs that produce facehugger-like creatures (the same ones featured in the original game). The end-of-level boss is an alien shrine with a skull. 

* Area 4 - 1st Alien Lair (side-view) - This takes place inside an alien nest. The enemies are now xenomorph-like creatures and mutant mouths that shoot alien spawns. The sub-boss is an alien hovercraft composed of skulls, while the end-of-level boss is a flying alien. 

* Area 5 - 2nd Alien Lair (top-view) - The final stage, filled with mouths emerging from the ground, flying heads and spider-like creatures. The final boss is Gaver, a giant alien head with snake-like arms.

You're not exactly helpless, though. You have balloon bombs which you can lay and detonate, rocks on top of the house to drop, floors that move across when you step on them and pools of water under bridges which you open by walking over them. All these can kill cats and cobras, if you use them right.

		<desc>Whoo hoo, this game is nothing but dot eating fun. You play the game one screen at a time, and each screen will be covered with dots, baddies, and will have a few logs thrown in to boot. What you are trying to do is either eat all the dots, or kill all the monsters. There are two basic kinds of enemies (plus a few more that will sometimes escort the bonus letters). The first kind is a sort of green clam, these are slow moving and pose little danger to Mr. Do. But the second kind is fairly dangerous, it is a purple cartoon snake, and it will make quick rolling attacks at Mr. Do!, you must dodge these, as your powerball is ineffective against a rolling snake. Both enemy types will sometimes transform into a purple sightless unicorn if they manage to remain alive long enough, shoot the unicorns as soon as they appear, because you cannot outrun them over long distances.

Mr. Do! has two things to defend himself with. The first is the superball, he starts out carry this, simply toss it at an enemy, and they will vanish (you can also bounce the superball off of walls for a higher score). Your superball regenerates as you eat dots and fruit, and it is often a good idea to use it as soon as it regenerates (to take out yet another baddie). Your other weapon is the logs that are scattered around the game board. Simply push them, and they will roll down the screen, taking out anything in their path (including Mr. Do! if you are dumb enough to get in their way).

You leave a line behind you as you walk, when you meet your own line (creating a box), any dots inside the box will be upgraded to cherries, while cherries upgrade to apples, which upgrade to lemons, which finally upgrade to pineapples. You don't have to do any of this fruit upgrade stuff at all, but is the best way to rack up a lot of points. You can collect letters to spell EXTRA to get a free man (just like all the other "Mr. Do!" games).

		<name>Super Punch-Out!! </name>
		<desc>Super Punch-Out!! is an update of the superb boxing game, "Punch-Out!!", featuring five new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'. 

As with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent. 

Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. 

Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game.

		<desc>Super Xevious Gump no Nazo is a vertical shooter by Namco. Interestingly, this is a Famicom exclusive sequel to Xevious and not a port of the arcade game of the same name released in 1984. "GAMP no Nazo" translates as "GAMP's mystery" and this is where the game greatly differs from other Xevious games. The essential task of each stage is for the player to fulfill a certain condition. Each one of the sixteen levels just loops until the condition is fully satisfied and each area features a different puzzle to solve. The objectives vary from finding the stage's hidden exist to destroying all the objects of a particular kind. The player takes control of the Solvalou and can shoot ahead and drop bombs in the classic Xevious tradition. However, Super Xevious now features power-ups. A small spaceship appears in almost every stage and drops colored power-capsules - the black ones activate a rotating shield, the yellow ones equip a large bomb-target and then the blue ones allows the ship to also fire backward.

		<name>Tac/Scan </name>
		<desc>Tac/Scan is a 1 or 2-player alternate action game, displayed via Sega's Color X-Y video system. Commanding unprecedented firepower, the player maneuvers seven fighter ships in a squadron formation. All seven ships fire at once when the Fire button is pressed, producing a spectacular missile salvo.

The object of the game is to accumulate points by destroying incoming enemy ships while dodging fireballs launched by these enemies. Tac/Scan presents the space battle from two entirely different perspective views in the course of the game, with visually exciting transition sequences interconnecting the two views.

The player begins the game with a seven-ship formation, and a supply of reserve ships which are shown above the player score on the screen. The number of reserve ships at the beginning of the game is switch selectable. An Add Ship button placed next to the Fire button transfers one of the reserve ships in the squadron formation. Where the reserve ships are placed is shown by a half-intensity fighter in the formation. This 'add ship' position continuously cycles between the empty squadron positions, and the advanced player will time the Add Ship function to place squadron fighters at preferred positions.

A player fighter is blown up by contact with either an enemy ship or an enemy fireball. Whenever all seven ship positions become empty the game is over, even if there are remaining reserve fighters shown above the player score. Thus the player must continuously judge when to add reserve fighters by using the Add Ship button. Add them too early, and they might be depleted too fast; use them too late and you risk ending the game with reserve fighters left over.

There is an additional way to add ships to the squadron. During the course of the action, player fighter ships enter the playfield and intermix with the enemy ships. The player can capture these fighters directly into the seven ship formation by steering them into empty fighter positions. The player's missile fire does not blow up friendly fighters--only enemy ships.

Tac/Scan begins with a top view of the battle. For the first ten seconds the player shoots at enemy ships without having to worry about return fire. After this 'warm-up' period, game play escalates dramatically. During this first phase, a different type of enemy appears just after two of the player fighters fly onto the screen. This is the Stinger, which flits around the field and shoots a deadly laser. This ship is a high priority target, since if not dealt with, it will pick off all of the squadron ships and end the game.

When the player attempts to dock a friendly fighter into the squadron formation, he or she has the choice of any of the empty ship positions shown in the squadron. A special feature occurs when the player ship docks into the front-most ship position (marked with a red 'cursor'). Thin causes the squadron formation to regroup into a different pattern. If the load position is occupied, a fighter is added to the reserve count above the player's score.

At the end of the first phase (the top view) the squadron ships regroup, and a dramatic transition sequence takes the player into phase two. This sequence consists of the fighters rising and enlarging in size, then turning into the screen, lighting afterburners, and proceeding to fly forward to continue the battle. The enemy ships now appear far off in the distance, and grow in size as they approach the player's squadron. The player is given chances to rendezvous with friendly fighters, as in phase one.

At the end of this second phase, a space tunnel appears on the screen, and the player uses the rotary control to steer the squadron formation through the tunnel. Any fighter which hits a side wall of the tunnel explodes on contact. A triangular guide is shown during this sequence to show the player where his triangular ship formation should be. If the player keeps the formation centered within the guide, no ships will be lost.

Once out of the space tunnel, the player resumes with the second round. This is a more difficult top view battle, as at the beginning of the game. Tac/Scan proceeds with multiple two-phase rounds (phase one is the top view, phase two is the rear view) until all squadron ships are lost.

A switch option allows bonus reserve chips to he added with certain score values. The factory set option is to add one reserve ship every 30,000 points.

Regardless of the number of squadron ships on the screen, there are always seven missiles at a time available to the player. If there are seven ships on the screen (a full squadron), pressing the Fire button launches all seven at once. Another push of the Fire button cancels the seven in flight and launches seven new ones. If the squadron is not full, the seven missiles can be independently targeted. For example, with a single ship, seven missiles can be fired in seven directions, and only when the eighth is shot is the first one terminated (if it is still on the screen).

The 2-player game is played with players alternating after successful negotiation of the space tunnel. Whenever a player is eliminated, the other player continues and finishes the game.

		<desc>A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either 'Leonardo' (blue, katana blades), 'Raphael' (red, sais), 'Michaelangelo' (orange, nunchakas) or 'Donatello' (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to try and rescue 'April O'Neil' and 'Splinter', before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies 'Krang' and 'The Shredder'.

Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for 'Jump' and 'Attack' - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a 'buy-in' option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.

		<name>Tempest (rev 1) </name>
		<desc>2,295. 25,113 Upright units were produced. Tempest sold approximately 20,000 units to distributors before it was even released. 

Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. It is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace. 

Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. Tempest was originally a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone called 'Vortex', but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit. 

The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around. 

* The Creation of Tempest : Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different. 

Rich Adam : "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game... and he said to himself : 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.". 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. 

Dave Theurer : "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.". 

Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. 

Dan Pliskin : "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.". 

* Popular from the Start : Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. 

Lyle Rains : "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things". 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Not only did players often find a sense of welcome escape in the video games they played, but this was very much the intention of some of the great game designers. 

Dave Theurer : "I want to design it for a guy who's totally frazzled by his job and needs a way to temporarily escape. There's a certain class of games... where you just get into a trance when you're playing them. As long as you're in this trance you'll do fine." 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TEMPEST. 

A Tempest unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Twilight Zone - The Movie', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' (A cocktail cabinet) and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'. 

A Tempest unit appears in the music video 'Subdivisions' by RUSH. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. It is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace. 

Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. Tempest was originally a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone called 'Vortex', but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit. 

The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around. 

* The Creation of Tempest : Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different. 

Rich Adam : "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game... and he said to himself : 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.". 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. 

Dave Theurer : "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.". 

Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. 

Dan Pliskin : "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.". 

* Popular from the Start : Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. 

Lyle Rains : "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things".

		<name>Terra Cresta (YM3526 set 1) </name>
		<desc>Terra Cresta is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set over a constantly scrolling landscape of islands and enemy installations. The player is under constant attack from enemy spaceship waves, ground-based guns and turrets, dinosaurs and three different mothercraft ships. 

The levels are littered with ground-based silos bearing numbers between 2 and 5. These can be shot to release a player ship component, which then attaches to the player's current ship, increasing both its size and firepower. Power-ups available are 2-Wide shot, 3-Rear Shot, 4-Front cannon and 5-Rear shield. 

Using the 'Formation' button splits the ship parts into a formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation. For example, if the player has picked up two ship parts then a triangle is formed, with the player's main ship at the rear of the formation, with additional two ship components positioned at the front edge of the triangle. 

When all four numbered parts have been collected, the player's ship transforms into a flaming Phoenix, and is indestructible for a limited time.

		<name>The King of Dragons (Japan 910805, B-Board 90629B-3) </name>
		<desc>The King Of Dragons is a side scrolling Beat 'em up and is one of Capcom's long series of side-scrolling beat' em ups that flooded the arcades back in the 1990s. This title is however rather unusual and takes place in a fantasy world populated with beefy warriors and evil dragons. The world is devastated by a red and ferocious dragon and the game spreads along no less than fifteen stages. Five playable characters are available from the start : the strong warrior, the cleric, the magical wizard, the light elf and the heavy dwarf. Obviously, each character has its own strengths and weaknesses and they can receive various upgrades throughout the game in the shape of new weapons, shields or new staffs. They can also level-up and consequently increase their life bars. Heroic fantasy games wouldn't be complete without magic, and magic there is - simple lightning bolt attacks can be triggered by any player and can damage several enemies at once. It is interesting to notice that a two simultaneous player option is available.

But one day, a gigantic leopard seal appears from nowhere and stuffs all the poor birds in his giant bag to sell them on the black market. Tiki manages to escape his captor and decides to help his friends. But our hero is not your traditional Kiwi - He comes equipped with a bow and arrows and special items can get him to throw bombs, fire lasers and even steal and ride his opponents' flying vehicles.

		<name>The Simpsons (4 Players World, set 1) </name>
		<desc>A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.

The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.

		<desc>Time Pilot '84 is an eight-way scrolling shoot 'em up and is the sequel to 1982's 'Time Pilot'. As with the prequel, the game's stages are set over different periods in time. Players must destroy a set number of enemy ships, after which an end-of-level guardian appears. Once this is destroyed the player's ship warps to the next stage. 

The player's ship is armed with both a forward-firing gun and an infinite number of homing missiles. Each stage consists of both green and metallic enemies, the green enemies can be destroyed with the standard gun, but both metallic enemies and the end-of-stage guardian can only be killed with homing missiles. As the player's ship gets close to a metallic enemy, a "lock-on" square will appear over it, fired homing missiles will then follow and hit the enemy. 

Unlike the prequel, which displayed the year in which each level was set, the time periods of 'Time Pilot '84' are indicated by new enemies and different backgrounds.

		<desc>1 or 2 players operate a jeep and must battle their way through a huge, vertically scrolling battlefield. Their mission is to save PoWs and deliver them to the nearest helicopter pad so they can be flown to safety. The hostages are trapped in enemy buildings and PoW camps, which must be destroyed in order to release the prisoners. The jeep can only carry up to a maximum of eight PoWs, the current amount being carried is displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.

The jeep is armed with a machine gun and a grenade thrower, the latter of which can be powered-up into a missile launcher. As well as huge numbers of enemy troops and static gun emplacements, the players must also contend with enemy jeeps, tanks, boats, submarines and planes. The final part of the game takes place in the enemy stronghold and the game ends when the final enemy gun emplacements are destroyed.

Toobin' was a classic example of Atari's genius approach to abstract game design, that would typify their heyday of the mid-to-late 80s.

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TOOBIN.

Special Contest Feature : Every Toobin' game in the U.S. has a special contest. A player can win a free Toobin' t-shirt just for playing the game and finding and picking up all seven characters to spell the word Toobin' (including the apostrophe). These characters are hidden in the river below obstacles and hazards. The letters collected by the player are shown at the beach party at the end of the run. For more contest details, see the game (The offer expired December 1, 1988).

		<desc>Top Secret is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set ten years after the end of World War III, with the player taking on the role of 'Super Joe'; an elite Commando tasked with infiltrating the enemy's heavily defended military base to discover their secrets plans and destroy their missile silos. 

To aid him in his mission, Joe is equipped with a bionic arm; a telescopic grappling hook that is used to traverse the many platforms and ledges that make up the game's levels. The arm can also be used to temporarily stun enemies or knock them from platforms, as well as to retrieve the bonus items, wooden crates and weapons that are occasionally dropped into the war zone by parachute. 

As well as the bionic arm, Joe is armed with a shotgun used to kill enemies and destroy obstructions. The shotgun can only be fired left and right, however, and cannot be used at the same time as the bionic arm. More powerful guns can be picked up throughout the game. 

Bionic Commando consists of five stages: 
* Stage 1: Forest 
* Stage 2: Enemy Outpost (The Forefront) 
* Stage 3: Underground Base (Infiltration) 
* Stage 4: Control Tower 
* Stage 5: Stop the Missile 

In the final level, Joe must stop a nuclear missile from launching, before a final confrontation with the game's final boss, the leader of the enemy forces.

		<name>Tora e no Michi (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Tora-he no Michi is a side scrolling action game by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name. Lee Wong is a young monk and a student of the Oh-Lin school of martial arts. He's also a master of the legendary Oh-Lin Tiger techniques. One day, the warriors of the Dragon God went to rob the four secret scrolls from the Oh-Lin temple and kidnapped all the children from the village. The bald and axe-swinging monk doesn't have much choice; he must now go through five long areas, and save the children and reclaim the Oh-Lin scrolls. Lee comes equipped with an axe - a weapon of limited range and accuracy. However, more weapons can be collected along the way by cracking open treasure chests and statues. The two other available weapons are the Mace (weak but covers a large area) and the Spear (fast but short range). Other special items are also available for the taking - Health Bottles, Invincibility Crystal Balls, Lives, keys (to unlock special doors) or Capcom's trademark POW icon which upgrades Lee's current weapon. Each area is divided into sub-levels and some even branch out and allow players to fight different bosses. Interestingly, each area ends with a small training session where the monk can improve his fighting skills and techniques. There, Lee can gain extra health or learn a new and powerful Tiger Attack. The monk has few more tricks up his sleeves and parts of the game feature vertical-scrolling flying stages. Finally, Tora-he no Michi has a save feature and allows the player to continue from the last visited sub-stage, but a device with built-in backup RAM is necessary (such as a CD-ROM unit or a Tennokoe 2 Bank).

		<desc>The game is a very simple game of baseball, implemented with stick figures. The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a 'swing' button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.

		<desc>A pseudo-sequel to Williams' superb 1990 shoot-em-up, "Smash TV", Total Carnage is set in a futuristic parody of the first Gulf War. General Ahkboob, himself an obvious parody of Sadam Hussein, has set his vast army of infantry, tanks and BioGenetic Mutants onto the world.

1 or 2 players must fight through the enemy-packed levels, rescuing reporters and civilians as they go. Total Carnage retains the dual-joystick control of its predecessor, but introduced new weapons, enemies and large, scrolling levels to the original game-play.

As with "Smash TV", Total Carnage features the infamous 'Pleasuredome'; accessible only if players manage to collect the 220 keys that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Total Carnage has a much higher difficulty level than that of "Smash TV".

		<name>Treasure Hunt (bootleg?) </name>
		<desc>This game plays a lot like "Donkey Kong" except that the controls are not quite as smooth. There are five screens to master if you want to help Jack in his mission. You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen one right to screen four.
* The first screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).
* In the second screen, Jack maneuvers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.
* The third screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.
* On the fourth screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.
* The fifth screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).

After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.

A gorilla, ghost, eraser and burst of fire all wander the paths. The eraser erases uncompleted squares and the gorilla would love to hammer you. But you're not defenceless. With three swift punches you can knock them out, except for the fire which can't be stopped. Each level introduces a larger area to fill so keep moving!

		<desc>1 to 4 players take on the role of a cute dinosaur, selected from the four on offer : Rex (red), Bloop (blue), Spike (yellow) and Gwen (lavender). The game takes place in a prehistoric land called 'Og' and is made up of forty-nine different islands; the dinos must collect all of the dinosaur eggs that lay on the islands, while avoiding the unwanted attention of a tribe of one-eyed cavemen, called 'Trogs'. The dinos can punch the attacking Trogs; one punch will only stun a Trog but several punches will knock the enemy off the screen. There are 4 different Trogs who pursue the dinos :
* Brown Trogs who use only their fists.
* Red Trogs who use clubs and create fires or holes in the ground.
* Blue Trogs who pop up out of the ground and roll stone wheels.
* Green Trogs who bounce around trying to crush you with their springs.
On each island, after the dinos have gathered up all of their eggs, they must make their way to the base labeled 'Home'; from here they will move on to the next island.

Between each stage, there is an intermission where the players' Dinos will dance, with an on-screen caption proudly declaring 'Excellent!', 'Congratulations!', 'Nice Work!', 'Good Job!' or 'Dino-Mite!'. On occasion, an intermission screen appears that shows a Trog planning another attempt to eat a Dino.

		<name>Tron (6/25) </name>
		<desc>Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name.

Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called "domains", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen.

The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows:

* LIGHT CYCLES : The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed.

* I/O TOWER : Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* TANK MAZE : Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. "Recognizer" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* MCP CONE : Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the "SCORING" section for details).

		<desc>An abstract take on the 3d racing genre, Tropical Angel puts the player in control of a female water-skier who must dodge the many rocks that protrude from the water while attempting to steer through a set number of gates - in the form of a pair of flags - before the time limit expires. The acceleration button needs to be held down all the time while the 'trick' button makes the water-skiing girl spin through one-eighty degrees and proceed to ski backwards. The player cannot steer while traveling backwards, but will earn bonus points for the duration of the trick. As the game progresses, small ramps, buoys and sharks come into play. The small ramps can be jumped to add to the player's score, although they're always in difficult to reach locations. The buoys are usually very close together, but skiing between them earns bonus points. Finally, the shark will appear from time-to-time, running into it means game over, regardless of how much time the player has left.

		<desc>Sega's Turbo is a 3-D racing game from Sega in which the player must pass a set number of rival racers (usually 30) before the time limit expires. Success would see the player progress to the next stage. Turbo's gameplay was unique in that centered ENTIRELY on the passing of cars; while the tracks the player raced on had all of the usual bends and turns of the racing genre, they existed purely for effect and at no point did the player actually have to STEER through them.

Turbo was the world's first full-color, sprite scaling racing game and not, as many assume, Namco's "Pole Position". Turbo was released a full year before the Namco legend and is a further example of how Sega has dominated and innovated within the arcade racing genre.

Top scores were kept on a LED panel to the left of the screen (unfortunately these scores reset every-time you turn the game off).

		<name>Turkey Shoot </name>
		<desc>The year is 1989, one year after the great gobble blight which plagued the world. One-third of the earth's populace was transformed by the ailment. The side effect of the turkey transformation is a tendency toward violence and comradery between these turkeys to organize for rabble-rousing in the urban areas. In February of '89, a group of specially trained agents (the turkey terminators) was formed for the sole task of destroying the turkey menace...

And so it begins. As a Turkey Terminator, the player is given 100 missions and 3 weapons to eliminate all the turkeys, leaving no 'left-overs'. He can take aim with his lethal laser gun using the position dot on the screen Screen-shot to hone in on his enemies with deadly accuracy. He can launch a lit grenade to annihilate all the turkeys within range or he can activate his gobble button (available one time each mission) to freeze all the turkeys for an instant, making them 'sitting ducks'. Missions are varied and include reacting quickly to clever ploys such as turkey air raids, turkeys disguising themselves as businessmen and turkey helicopter get-aways. Every 8th round is a rapid-fire bonus wave where the player has 15 seconds to eliminate as many criminals as possible. Shooting fire hydrants and trash cans as well as freeing bystanders who have been taken hostage also score bonus points.

Three 'fowl-ups' are allowed and occur whenever any turkey... a Pilot Turkey, Boss Turkey, Cyborg Turkey or Thug Turkey... escapes or when an innocent bystander... a businessman, shopper or policeman... is damaged.

		<name>Two Tigers (dedicated) </name>
		<desc>Two Tigers is a 2-D shooter. The game starts by telling you how may hits you must make on the ship before you can claim credit for sinking it. You then will go to the next screen which has your fighter/bomber in the middle of the screen. A gunsight will also be somewhere in the sky (the gunsight is actually the spot where anti-aircraft fire will be hitting at). Soon the sky is filled with enemy planes and a ship enters the screen from the left side. You mission will be to do whatever it takes to put the required number of holes into the enemy ship to sink it. You have at your disposal a single bomb and the enemy planes themselves for achieving your goal. Along the way, other things may assist (if you shoot them) such as mines and fuel drums. The game will go until you fail to sink 2 ships. If you are in 2-player cooperative mode, then the number of holes to sink a ship will be increased. The same rules apply, though, for sending it to the bottom of the sea.

As with the original, players chose any one of three different jet fighters and battle their way through ten enemy-packed stages. Another idea carried over from Area 88 is the end-of-level shop, which allows players to buy weapon and shield upgrades for their jet fighter.

		<name>Valkyrie No Densetsu (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Valkyrie no Densetsu is an action/adventure game by Namco and conversion of the arcade game of the same name. A cute and courageous young Valkyrie is sent from heaven to save the country of Marvel Land. She is accompanied by Sandora, a green looking creature from the Sandora clan who is on a long journey in search of the Golden Seed, a magical artifact capable of granting all wishes. But the seed has only brought chaos and disaster to the world and Valkyrie is given the mission to find it and to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands. With her sword and magic powers, she travels through six large areas - from swamps to rocky hills, deep caves and creepy dungeons. Coins can be collected along the way to purchase various items and new weapons from shops scattered (and sometimes hidden) around the game. The extensive list of items ranges from additional health containers, healing herb, wide beam shots, drill shots, four-way shots and so forth. Each special weapon only come in limited quantities though and disappears when it runs out of ammo. Valkyrie can also use her divine magic powers to cast powerful spells such as the multiple-valkyrie, the bomb or one that makes her grow to an enormous size. The game has somewhat of an adventure feel to it and each area has its share of special events that need to be resolved for extra bonuses. Other stages feature hidden villagers who ask the valkyrie questions and right answers are rewarded with special items or spells. Later stages also have a non-linear structure to them and different paths lead to different areas to explore. The game is vast and a password system allows the player to continue an earlier game.

		<desc>So you enlisted for adventure, did you? Well, you've come to the right place. Your mission is to reach the City of Mystery at the end of the tunnel and destroy the great Gond with your four- directional laser guns. Sound easy? Wait and see.

First you have to make it through the seven tunnel zones without getting smashed on the tunnel walls, crunched by enemy objects, or zapped by missiles. The more enemy objects you destroy, the more points you earn, but the rougher it gets. If you make it to the City of Mystery and destroy Gond, you earn bonus points. Then you head into the next tunnel, which also leads to the City of Mystery and Gond. Then what? Well, to quote an old Aterrian saying, "Life is just one tunnel after another."

Now before you climb into your spaceship and enter the first tunnel, take a look at the options.

		<desc>Venture is a 1- or 2-player "Gauntlet" style game (although Venture pre-dates the Atari legend by 4 years) set in a multi-level dungeon. The player, armed with a bow and arrow fights through enemy infested levels in the quest to collect treasure.

Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of "Space Invader" like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.

When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice. Once a room has been cleared of its item, the player no longer has access to that room. The player must collect all of the treasures on the current level before descending to another dungeon.

		<name>Vulgus (Japan?) </name>
		<desc>Vulgus is pretty simple. You just pilot a spaceship and blast countless enemies. That is what is fun about this game. There is nothing complicated, just pure blasting. You only have two weapons, your blaster, and a limited supply of bombs. This title uses the time honored top-down vertically scrolling format. The background moves eternally forward, but you can move all around the screen, and can make the screen scroll both left and right. Your enemies consist of an assortment of fairly realistic looking spacecraft, some of which have a distinctive 'insectoid' look to them. This game is endless and it doesn't seem to have a level format. You just move forward and shoot. The backgrounds will change from time to time from planetary surfaces to space scenes and eventually they will start repeating once you blast this particularly large alien formation.

		<desc>Wacko is a colorful single screen shooter, with excellent graphics for the time. You maneuver Kapt'n Krooz'r around the screen in his spaceship. The terrain is an orange moon scene, various cartoonish monsters dot the landscape. You must blast the monsters in pairs to make them vanish. Later levels introduce even more complex rules as to what can be shot. You control your ship with the trackball, while using the joystick to aim and shoot. The controls feel natural with a little practice, but the game quickly becomes very difficult on the higher levels.

		<desc>A demanding yet superb sprite-scaling racing game from Konami, based on the annual 'WEC Le Mans 24' race; a grueling event that, as its name suggests, takes place over a 24-hour period.

The width of Le Mans' racetrack never varied and remained a constant 3 lanes wide. The track itself was incredibly demanding and contact with either a rival racer or one of the many track-side objects would send the player's vehicle flying dramatically through the air, costing valuable seconds in time.

Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups.

The player's character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player's command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.

The player's life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player's mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.

		<desc>Willow is a sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up game loosely based upon the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of one of two characters: Willow Ufgood or Madmartigan. The hero's mission is to rescue the baby Elora Danan from the evil Queen Bavmorda and bring her back safely. If the quest fails, the Queen will plunge the world into darkness and chaos.

The game consists of 6 levels, each representing a scene from the movie. Defeated enemies drop gold coins that can be collected by the player. In addition, each level is littered with locked treasure chests that can be shot open and the treasure within collected. The gold can be used to purchase a number of weapons and character power-ups from a nearby shop (represented on screen by a wise old man). All power-ups will stay with the player until all lives are lost and the game is over.

		<name>Wizard of Wor </name>
		<desc>Welcome to WIZARD OF WOR! In this magical game, you are a worrior descending into deep dungeon mazes, battling invisible monsters, cacodemons, and maybe even the Wizard of Wor himself! Be of good cheer, worrior, for herein lie many of the secrets of the Wizard. 

Wizard of Wor is a game for 1 or 2 players. When the 2-player mode is selected, both players control their worriors at the same time. Teamwork in the 2-player mode is very important (but not necessary to play). 

The object of Wizard of Wor is to descend as far into the dungeons of Wor as possible, killing monsters, beating the Wizard, and earning as high a score as you can. The game ends when all the players' worriors have been destroyed. 

At the start of the game, you are placed in dungeon one. It contains six blue Burwors. Using the joystick and fire button, maneuver your worrior around the maze and shoot them. As you shoot the last Burwor, a yellow Garwor will come out. Garwors and red Thorwors will turn invisible. The radar will show the positions of the invisible monsters. Invisible Garwors and Thorwors will become visible when they enter the same corridor that a worrior is in. As time goes by, the monsters speed up. The longer it takes before you shoot them, the faster they go. When you have destroyed the Thorwor, the first dungeon ends. 

In the 2nd dungeon, a different maze is randomly selected. Once again, six Burwors are placed here. More Garwors and Thorwors will appear this time, however. When the last Thorwor has been shot, Worluk will come out and try to escape out one of the side doors. If you shoot him before he escapes, all point values will be doubled in the next dungeon. After Worluk has been shot or has escaped, the Wizard of Wor may then appear. He teleports closer and closer, continuously firing lightning bolts. He continues to do so until either one worrior has been destroyed, or the Wizard has been shot. 

After dungeon 3 or 4, a bonus player is awarded (option switch selectable). You must then face the Arena. This is the toughest of the lower level dungeons. The Worlord dungeons begin at dungeon eight. They are very difficult to survive. At dungeon thirteen, another bonus player is awarded, and you must try to win your way through The Pit. The ultimate goal of Wizard of Wor is to survive The Pit without losing any worriors. 

In a 1-player game, the other worrior (blue) is your friend. He will not shoot you unless you come between him and a monster, then he will try to shoot the monster, and you could be hit by his shot. 
In a 2-player game, both players play at the same time. They do not take turns. The two players may elect to shoot each other. But, if you wish to survive for long, you must use teamwork! 

And now worrior, go forth and do battle with the Wizard of Wor!

		<name>Yie Ar Kung-Fu (program code G) </name>
		<desc>Yie Ar Kung Fu is a classic one-on-one fighting game that pits a single player against a procession of distinctive, and often armed opponents. While somewhat limited in gameplay terms, Yie Ar Kung-Fu introduced a major innovation to the beat-em-up genre as it was the first one-on-one fighter to offer a progression of truly different opponents for the player to defeat. This is something that would later be adopted by Capcom for its legendary Street Fighter series; as well as SNK and countless others. Many of Yie Ar's eleven opponents are armed with a wide variety of weapons, such as a nunchuks, throwing stars, a chain, a sword and a club.

Yie Ar Kung-Fu is a game of reflexes and as such plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting 'pegged in' by some of the game's tougher opponents. The first five fights take place in front of an animated waterfall, while the remaining six have the player battling in front of a picturesque, oriental pagoda. There is no time limit set in which the opponent must be defeated and the player's character, Oolong, possesses a finite amount of health per stage. Should the player's health bar be fully depleted, the match is lost.

		<desc>In this title you play a little farmer guy, who is attempting to shoot down the crows out of his tree. Gameplay is identical to that of "Space Invaders". A large bird replaces the UFO that goes over the top of the screen from time to time. While a lumberjack will chop out a section of the tree every time the birds reach the side of the screen (lowering them closer to the bottom). The only real gameplay difference is that the birds come in a pyramid pattern, as opposed to the rectangle pattern of "Space Invaders". This serves to make the game much easier.

		<name>Zaxxon (set 2) </name>
		<desc>Zaxxon is a unique isometric perspective, in which you find yourself piloting an 'attack-shuttle' spacecraft, strafing the enemy's asteroid city in an attempt to destroy fuel tanks, gun emplacements, missiles, fighters and the dreaded Zaxxon enemy robot. With the aid of an altimeter that constantly monitors your height, you control your ship with an aircraft-style joystick, barnstorming your way through wall openings, under electronic barriers, dodging rockets, and in a later round, duelling with Zaxxon, the insidious enemy robot. A successful attack-run across the first platform leads us to a deep-space dogfight with enemy planes. As you climb, turn and dive, a 'cross-hair' appears on the screen to indicate exact positioning for a laser hit on incoming craft. Notice the buffeting as you fly near 'proximity explosions'. In addition to your altitude, a running count is displayed of your score, number of ships remaining to you, number of enemy ships remaining to be destroyed, and fuel remaining. Fuel bonuses, as well as points, are awarded for destroying fuel tanks, but your ship crashes if you run out of fuel between rounds.

After a specified number of enemy ships are destroyed, Zaxxon appears, launching seeker-missiles. Destruction of Zaxxon requires six direct hits on the robot's missile launcher, after which the round changes with greater difficulty. Number of player ships and bonus point levels are operator selectable. Game play ends with the loss of your last ship.

		<name>Zektor (revision B) </name>
		<desc>Zektor is a one- or two-player game that tasks you with the liberation of eight cities that have been seized by the evil cadre of alien robots. In order to liberate a city, you must defeat three attack waves of fighters and robo-probes. Fighters and Robo-probes are often shielded (in red), and each consecutive hit reduces the enemies shield strength, until, when the shield drops, a hit will destroy it. In addition, you will encounter three types of Moboids :
* Green Moboids spin the players ship on contact, and bounce enemy ships.
* Blue Moboids bounce all ships.
* Red Moboids destroy all un-shielded ships (including the players ship).

After defeating three attack waves, the Alien Robot holding that city will reappear within rotating protective rings, through which a 'slot shot' neutralizes that Robot, awarding the player a bonus ship and advancement to the next round.

		<desc>A challenging, vertical scrolling shooter.

On deep space you must fly the 'Zogram' (your spaceship fighter) and destroy hordes of enemies, while dodge space objects.

Destroy eight 'Mitiohro' around the 'Goke' (the enemy base) for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' (the enemy's fighter). After destroying all the 'Mitiohro', return to the 'Battlestar-asat' base.

The color of 'Mitiohro' on the picture changes when the gates for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' opens. It is the time to attack!

As you destroy 'Ahro', 'Mitiohro' becomes to leave the 'Goke's' body, but you cannot destroy those 'Mitiohro' with your laser beam.

You can get a higher score depending of the precision landing of your spaceship at nearer spot to the center of the 'Battlestar-asat' base.

When you score 20,000 points, you can get one more Zogram and at 50,000 points you can get another Zogram.

		<name>Zoo Keeper (set 1) </name>
		<desc>Zoo Keeper is a superb, fast-paced arcade game in which the player takes control of Zeke the zoo-keeper. Many of the animals at Zeke's zoo are running wild and have captured Zeke's girlfriend, Zelda. Zeke must recapture as many animals as possible and rescue his sweetheart from the animals' clutches.

Zoo Keeper features two different, alternating play fields, with each level having its own task to complete; as well as a final 'bonus screen'. The three levels are as follows :

On the first play field, players must move Zeke around the outside of an animal enclosure, constantly re-building the enclosure wall that the animals are set on destroying. Any wild animals that are loose must be jumped over or the player will lose a life. The level's timer is represented as a fizzing fuse, and along this fuse are a number of bonus items such as beer or a net for catching escaped animals. When the timer's fuse reaches an item, it will appear on screen and can be picked up. Once the timer makes it to the word 'End', the current level is completed and play moves on to the next level. The bonus items that occasionally appear include mugs of beer, ice cream sundaes, clover clubs, watermelons, etc.

If Zeke manages to pick up a net, he will be able to capture the animals and put them back into the Zoo. The net will eventually disappear and the captured animals will try to escape once more by breaking through the enclosure wall. Zeke will have to continue building the wall around the Zoo until the time is up. At the end of the level, bonus points are awarded for every animal inside the wall. Animals found on this level are snakes, moose, camels, rhinos, elephants and a lion.

On the second, more difficult play field, Zelda is tied to a palm tree and Zeke must rescue her by jumping to the top of the screen via a series of moving platforms; dodging the coconuts thrown by a mischievous monkey. On each of the platforms, various foods and drinks can collected to earn extra points. Sometimes, one of the ledges will have a 'Free Game' sign that will grant the player a free credit. While Zelda is tied up, she says 'save me', and whenever Zeke gets knocked out by one of the deadly coconuts, she says 'Oh, no!' If Zeke makes it all the way to the top and rescues her, she says 'My Hero' and a bonus of 5000 points is awarded.

The first and second screens are alternated before the player finally reaches the third and final 'bonus screen'. Here, Zeke must jump over the herds of charging animals that are running from a cage at the foot of an escalator. Zeke must reach the escalator behind the animals' cage and make his way up to the next floor, where a second escalator - replete with more charging animals - awaits. Zeke must reach the top of the second escalator to rescue the trapped Zelda.

After Zeke has rescued Zelda on the final screen, the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.

		<desc>Zwackery was a sword-fighting and spell-casting game in which the player controls a cartoony wizard Zak Thwacker on a quest to restore an enchanted frog back into the buxom princess she once was. A platform-style exploration game, the world that Zak explores is actually dozens of different screens which the player exits and enters through doorways and tunnels in search of spell and other powerups that will help him defeat the Evil Ghoulum. The Sword can be used to stab, or it can be spun around the player. The Shield, which can be wielded in the same manner, provides protection. Spells include Bouncing Boots, Shooting Swords, Invisibility Potions, Magic flutes, and a Dragons Egg, which put Leapin Fungoes to sleep and allows safe passage through the Dragon's Lair.

		<name>Zzyzzyxx (set 1) </name>
		<desc>Perseverance will be overwhelming emotion game players as they move ZZYZZYXX up and down horizontal rows of alternating moving bricks to gather presents which will satisfy his love. Lola -- whose affection is not easily captured. ZZYZZYXX's vulnerability increases (as he collects gifts, as well as points) not only because of Lola's untouchable attitude, but because of obstacles such as rattifers trying to put an end to ZZYZZYXX's quest for Lola's love and affection.

Intelligent as the rattifers may be, there are 2 defenses ZZYZZYXX can use to outsmart the destructive creatures. ZZYZZYXX can brick himself within a brick when he sees an approaching rattifer or ZZYZZYXX can move into the space where there is a gold helmet. The gold helmet intensifies ZZYZZYXX's goal to reach Lola by allowing ZZYZZYXX to use the helmet to enclose a rattifer or break through one brick which is obstructing ZZYZZYXX's course towards Lola.

As irreproachable as Lola appears. Lola is overjoyed by ZZYZZYXX's success to retrieve enough presents and she whistles resoundingly to let ZZYZZYXX know. After ZZYZZYXX's triumphant deed for love. ZZYZZYXX becomes invincible, enabling him to elude the rattifers by imprisoning them within their spaces.

Other dangers testing ZZYZZYXX's skillful maneuvering are falling bombs, rising missiles and cracked bricks, each capable of disintegrating ZZYZZYXX.

As an added attraction, when a game player completes each level, there are animated cartoons depicting ZZYZZYXX's passionate desire to impress his love for Lola. Also delightful music throughout the game leaves the players humming and their foot tapping.
